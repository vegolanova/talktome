                                  "Shrek Forever After"

                                       SCENE 1:

Man's Voice: Once upon a time a long time ago, a king and a queen had
a beautiful daughter named Fiona.

Man's Voice: But she was possessed by a terrible curse. By day, a lovely princess; by
night, a hideous ogre.

Man's Voice: Only true love's kiss would lift her curse. So Fiona waited in a
tower, guarded by a dragon, until the day when her true love would arrive.

Man's Voice: But as the days turned into years, the King
and Queen were forced to resort to more desperate measures.

(Flashback) (Clip from the movie can be shown here)

King Harold: Ew!

Driver: (pulls reigns) Whoa, there!

King Harold: I don’t know about this, Lillian. Fairy Godmother said only true love’s
kiss could break Fiona’s curse.

Queen Lillian: I don’t trust that woman, Harold. This may be our last hope. Besides,
he does come highly recommended by King Midas.

King Harold: But to put our daughter’s life in the hands of this…person? He’s devious.
He’s deceitful. He’s...he’s…

(A bit later, the king and queen were inside the carriage as the owner spun around in
his chair, revealing himself. He was Rumpelstiltskin.)

Rumpelstiltskin: Rumpelstiltskin, at your service!

(Lightning flashed at the mention of his name. His pet goose, Fifi, honked a bit.
The little man kissed the uneasy Lillian's hand in respect.)

Rumpelstiltskin: Mrs. Highness.

Queen Lillian: How do you do?

Rumpelstiltskin: Down, Fifi. Get down!

(The goose did as her master said and went off to the side. Then the
deal maker rolled out a contract he had for the royal couple to sign.)

Rumpelstiltskin: As you can see, everything’s in order.

King Harold: So you’ll put an end to our daughter’s curse?
Rumpelstiltskin: And, in return, you sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to me.

King Harold: Lillian, this is madness!

Queen Lillian: What choice do we have? Fiona has been locked away in that tower far
too long.

Rumpelstiltskin: It’s not like she’s getting any younger.

King Harold: But to sign over our entire kingdom?

Rumpelstiltskin:
Well, if your kingdom’s worth more to you than your daughter…

(The king angrily stopped the paper.)

King Harold: Nothing is worth more to us than our daughter.

Rumpelstiltskin: I thought not.

Rumpelstiltskin: Jump, Fifi, jump!

Rumpelstiltskin: Just sign it and all your problems will disappear.

Messenger: Your Highness! The Princess! She’s been saved!

Rumpelstiltskin: Huh?!

Rumpelstiltskin: Who saved her?

(End of Flashback)

Rumpelstiltskin: No one would have guessed that an ogre named Shrek, whose roar
was feared throughout the land, would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.

Rumpelstiltskin: (irate) True love’s kiss led to marriage and ogre babies!

Rumpelstiltskin: The kingdom of Far Far Away was finally at peace.
(sarcastically) Goody for them!

Rumpelstiltskin: (furiously) AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY--

He ripped off that page, leaving the page of Shrek with Donkey and
Puss bumping fists.

Rumpelstiltskin: EVER--

Rumpelstiltskin: AFTER!!!

Pinocchio: Sir? You’re gonna have to pay for that.

Rumpelstiltskin: (stutters) M-m-maybe we could make a deal for it, little boy?
Pinocchio: Oh, I’m not a real boy.

Rumpelstiltskin: (smirks) Do you want to be?

Pinocchio: Nobody needs your deals anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!

Rumpelstiltskin:
(darkly) I wish that ogre was never born!



                                         SCENE 2:

Felicia: Wake up, Daddy, wake up!

Fiona: Good morning.

Shrek: Good morning to you too.

Fiona: (passes by) Better out than in.

Shrek:(chuckles) That’s MY line.

Tour Guide:(through megaphone) And on your left, the lovable lug that showed us you
don’t have to change your undies to change the world!

Tour Guide:(through megaphone) I wonder what Shrek’s up to in there.

Donkey:Play date!

Donkey:
(singing) Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall All you've got to do is call!

Puss: Then Shrek kissed the Princess. She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived…

Donkey: Happily…

Fiona: Ever…

Shrek: After.

Fiona: Look! A shooting star!

Shrek: So, what did you wish for?

Fiona: That every day could be like this one.

Shrek: Aww… (Shrek hugs Fiona)

Puss: (singing) One love One heart Let's get together and feel alright
Narrator: And so, as the days began to repeat themselves Shrek began to feel as if he
was no longer a real ogre anymore. He hung the poster up on the corner of the mirror,
and then he looked at the mirror, trying to see if he had any of it inside him.

Shrek: (softly) Roar. Roooooooaaaarr.

Narrator: It was no use though, he didn't even scare himself. He hung his
head, feeling his days as an ogre were truly gone.

(End of Scene 2)




                      SCENE 3 (KINGDOM OF FAR FAR AWAY)

(Full gang arrives for the birthday party of Shrek’s Children)

Donkey: Nice landing, honey.

(Donkey and Dragon Hug)

Donkey: And remember, no eating the valet.

Puss: Happy Birthday, ninos! Vamos a la fiesta!

Villagers:
Hey, Shrek! Shrek!

Villager 1:
(holds up his pitchfork's handle) Mr. Shrek, will you sign our pitchforks?

Villager 2:
(holds up his torch) And our torches?

Villager 3:
Man, you used to be so fierce!

Villager 2:
Yeah, when you were a real ogre.

Shrek:
(Puzzled) A "real" ogre?

(Shrek signs the pitchforks and walks away disgusted)

Pinocchio:
(singing) Happy Birthday Bash! No more diaper rash! One year older, not a
pain Friends still remain the same, refrain. Super duper, party pooper! Birthday,
birthday, birthday bash! Birthday, birthday, birthday bash!
(Crowd):
(Everyone except for Shrek) Birthday Bash! Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah!

Donkey:
Come on Shrek, it’s a sing-along. You’ve got to sing along!

Shrek: (Annoyed) No, thanks.

Donkey:
(Giving a sweet grin at Shrek) Please? I’ll be your best friend.

Shrek:
Since when does being your best friend entail me to do everything I don’t want to do?

Shrek:
Please, Felicia, not in daddy's ear.

Butterpants's Father: Excuse me, Mr. Shrek? Could you do that ogre roar of yours for
my son? He’s a big, big fan.

Butterpants:
Do the roar.

Shrek:
You know, I’d rather not, it’s my kids’ birthday party and-

Butter Pants:
Do the roar.

Fiona:
Honey? Why don't you go check on the cake?

Shrek:
(Annoyed) Sure.

He went to go check on the birthday cake.

Fiona:
And don’t forget the candles.

Muffin Man:
Hold still.

Gingy:
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man. I always wanted chaps! (prances around) Yee-
haw! Giddy up!

Muffin Man:
(grins) Ah, Monsieur Shrek.

Gingy:
Howdy, Shrek!
Muffin Man:
Your cake. Voila!

Shrek was appalled by the cake.

Shrek:
(Disgusted) What is that supposed to be?

Gingy:
That’s Sprinkles the Ogre!

Doris:
Isn’t he cute? He looks just like you.

Donkey:
Except happy. It’s a party, Shrek. You gotta cheer up!

Shrek, still feeling bitter, started carrying the cake away.

Shrek:
(Through his teeth) I’m in a great mood, actually.

Donkey:
(Excitedly) Oh, I’m gonna lick me a rainbow!

So he licked the cake.

Shrek:
Donkey!

Butterpants's Father: As long as you’re not doing anything, how about one
of those famous Shrek roars?

Butterpants:
Do the roar.

Shrek:
Let me set you straight, Butterpants. An ogre only roars when he’s angry. (chuckles a
bit) You don’t want to see me angry, do you?

Butterpants:
Do it.

He licked his lollipop, while Shrek just walked away, trying to keep his anger in.

Shrek:
(to himself) Hold it together. Just hold it together.

Butterpants:
Daddy, he’s getting away. Do something.

He set the cake down at the table Fiona was at.
Fiona:
Oh good.



Fiona:
(gasps) What happened to the cake?

Shrek:
Trust me, it's an improvement.

Queen Lillian:
(sees the cake) You licked it!

Shrek:
No.

Queen Lillian:
Just because you’re an ogre, doesn’t mean you have to eat like one.

Mabel:
Looks like you forgot the candles.

Fiona: OK, just watch the cake. I'll go get them.

Shrek:(confused) "Watch the cake"?

Shrek:
Ahh! Where's the cake?!

Heimlich:We ate ze cake.

Dieter:Ja.

Shrek:(shocked) What?

Shrek:
No, no. Don't cry, shhh.

Butterpants's Father: Hey! I believe you promised my son a roar.

Butterpants: Do the roar.

Shrek: Uh...(unconvincingly) roar.

Butterpants: Don't like it.

Shrek: Pigs, we need another cake.

Heimlich:But we ate ze ozer cakes.

Butterpants's Father: Come on man, One roar.
Donkey:
Hey, everybody! Shrek’s gonna do his famous ogre roar!

Shrek:
Not now, Donkey! Pigs, are there any cupcakes?

Dieter:
We ate zhem, too.

Heimlich:
Zhey have lollipops.

Horst:
No, I ate them.

Dieter:
What you didn’t share?

Horst:
(frowns) Well, you didn’t share the croissants!

Shrek:
Everything will be okay.

Fiona:
Shrek, what's going on?

Donkey:
Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!

Butterpants:
Do the roar.

Crowd:
We need the cake! (chanting) Cake! Cake! Cake!

Shrek:
RRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!!!!!

Butterpants:
(chuckles as he hugs his dad) I love you, daddy.

Puss:
Everybody, I have found...

Puss:
another cake!

Fiona:
Shrek? Are you OK?
Fiona:
Unbelievable.

Shrek:
Tell me about it! Those villagers…

Fiona:
I’m not talking about the villagers, Shrek. I’m talking about you. Is this really how you
want to remember the kids’ first birthday?

Shrek:
Oh, great. So this is all my fault?

Fiona:
Yes. But you know what? Let’s talk about this after the party, at home.

Shrek:
You mean that roadside attraction we live in? (mockingly) Step right up! (does
a mocking jolly dance) See the dancing ogre! Don’t worry! He won’t bite!

Shrek:
I used to be an ogre. Now I’m just a jolly green joke!

Fiona:
Okay, okay, maybe you’re not the ogre you used to be, but maybe that’s not such a bad
thing.

Shrek:
I wouldn’t expect you to understand. It’s not like you’re a real ogre. You spent half your
life in a palace.

Fiona:
(solemnly) And the other half locked away in a tower.

Shrek:
Look, all I want is for things to go back to the way they used to be! Back
when villagers were afraid of me, and I could take a mud bath in peace. When
I could do what I wanted, when I wanted to do it! Back when the world made sense!

Fiona:
You mean back before you rescued me from the Dragon’s Keep?

Shrek:
Exactly!

Fiona:
Shrek, you have three beautiful children, a wife who loves you, friends who adore you.
You have everything. Why is it the only person who can’t see that is you?

Shrek:
That’s just great.
Shrek:
If she thinks I’m gonna slink back there and apologize, she’s got another thing coming.
She’s not the boss of me. I’m an ogre and I’m not gonna apologize for acting like one.

Voice:
Help, please! Someone, anyone at all, help me! Please, help!

Rumpelstiltskin:
Please, help! I’m stuck! Help! Oh, please, help! Someone, anyone! Help me! The pain!

Rumpelstiltskin:
(squints eyes) I can see a bright light. A tunnel! Grandma? Is that you?

Shrek:
(dryly) Yeah, it’s me, Granny.

Rumpelstiltskin:
(pretend alarm) An ogre!

Rumpelstiltskin:
Please, Mr. Ogre, please don’t eat me!

Shrek:
I’m not gonna eat you.

Rumpelstiltskin:
But you are an ogre…(peeks out) aren’t you?

Shrek:
Yeah, well, I… I used to be. Look, move out or get crushed.

Rumpelstiltskin:
So you’re not gonna eat me?

Shrek:
(walks away) No, thanks. I already had a big bowl of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Wait up! What’s your rush? Where you going?

Shrek:
Nowhere.

Rumpelstiltskin:
(grins) What a coincidence! I was just heading that way myself. But, seriously, let me
give you a ride. I insist. Come on. It’s the least I can do after all you’ve done for me.

The ogre sighed, rolling his eyes, but it seemed like he was giving in.

Rumpelstiltskin:
I got a hot rat cooking.
Rumpelstiltskin:
All right! Can I interest you in a mudslide? Slug and tonic? A liquid libation to ease that
frustration?

He even made a fresh certain drink containing an eyeball.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Eyeball-tini?

Shrek:
Well, maybe just one.



Shrek:
So the centaur says, "That’s not the half I’m talking about."

Rumpelstiltskin:
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you. To live the life of an ogre…no worries, no responsibilities.
(takes a sip of an eyeball-tini) You are free to pillage and terrorize as you please.

Shrek:
Free? (chuckles and rolls eyes) That’s a laugh.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Oh, yeah?

Shrek:
Sometimes I wish I had just one day to feel like a real ogre again.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Why didn’t you say so? (stands up in his chair) Magical transactions are my specialty!
Come on!

Shrek:
Great. Next to mimes, magicians are my favourite people.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Hold on.

Rumpelstiltskin:
"King for a Month." "Knight for a Week." (finds one) Ah.



Rumpelstiltskin:
"Ogre for a day".

Rumpelstiltskin:
Think about it, Shrek. To be feared and hated. You’ll be, like, "Roar!" And
the villagers will be, like, (mimicking scared citizen) "Get away! It’s Shrek! I’m
so scared of him!" It would be just like the good old days, when your swamp was your
castle. When the world made sense.

Shrek:
All right, what’s the catch?

Rumpelstiltskin:
Catch? No. There’s no catch. No catchings, really. I mean, there’s something.
A small thing. Nothing. A little thing.

Shrek:
All right, I knew it. So what do you want?

Rumpelstiltskin:
A day.

Shrek:
(doubtful) A day?

Rumpelstiltskin:
Oh, rat’s done!

Rumpelstiltskin:
Well, to make the magic work, you gotta give something to get something. In this case,
you gotta give a day to get a day. That’s all.

Shrek:
I can’t just pick up and leave my family.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Oh, but that’s the best part, Shrek! It’s a magical contract. No one will even know you’re
gone, and by the time this day is up, (gives a smile) you are gonna feel like
a changed ogre.

Shrek:
Still, I don’t know.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Pffft! Hey, no problem. Forget it, no big deal. It doesn’t matter.

Shrek:
So what day would I have to give up?

Rumpelstiltskin:
I don’t know, any day. A day from your past. (starts carving the rat) A day you had the
flu? A day you lost a pet?

Rumpelstiltskin:
(bitterly/faster) A day some meddling oaf stuck his nose where it
didn’t belong destroying your business and ruining your life?!
Rumpelstiltskin:
Just for an example.

Shrek:
How about the day I met Donkey? (smirks) Now, there’s a day I’d like to take back.

He laughed, and the short man forced a laugh.

Rumpelstiltskin:
I don’t know who that is. (gets an idea) I know. What about a day you wouldn’t even
remember? Like a day when you were a baby.

Rumpelstiltskin:
An innocent, mindless little baby.

Shrek:
Take any of those days you want. Take them all for all I care.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Oh, just one will do.

Rumpelstiltskin:
OK, good. A day from your childhood it is.

Shrek:
I guess there’s nothing wrong with wanting a little time for myself.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Just 24 tiny little hours.

Shrek:
I’m still my own ogre!

Rumpelstiltskin:
Yeah, you is!

Shrek:
I never needed to ask for anyone’s permission before.

Rumpelstiltskin:
(pushes the contract towards him) So why start now?

Rumpelstiltskin:
Go on, Shrek. Sign it!

Rumpelstiltskin:
Go on, Shrek. Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!

Rumpelstiltskin:
Oh. You signed it.
Shrek:
So, tell me. What happens now?

Rumpelstiltskin:
(mockingly) Have a nice day.

                                        (Black out)




                                        (SCENE 4)

Shrek:
Whoooaaa! WHOOOOAAAAAAAAAA!!

Shrek:
(groans) I think I fell on my keys.

Tour Guide's Voice: There are 40 children in that shoe, which is why the weasel goes
pop to this very day.

Shrek:
Oh, great.

Tour Guide:
As we head over the river and through the woods, we come across…

Tourist:
(points) Ogre!

(Choir Song- Top of the World)

Shrek:(Sees a wanted picture of himself)
Sure is great to be wanted again. (sees another poster) Oh, nice one.

Shrek:
Fiona?

Oh, no.

Shrek:
My home. (runs to it) Fiona!

Fiona! Are you in there?!

Shrek:
(yelling out) All right, Rumpel! This wasn’t part of the deal!

Shrek:
Rumpel!
Broomsy:
(points) Ogre!

Broomsy:
We’ve got another one, ladies! Get him!

Shrek:
Who are you?! What are you doing in my swamp?

Broomsy:
Looks like a troublemaker!

Broomsy:
Get him

Broomsy:
Nice job, ladies!

Shrek:
You witches are making a big mistake! I know my rights!

Witch #2:
You have the right to shut your mouth!

Donkey's Voice:
(singing) Just thinking about tomorrow Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow 'Til
there's none

When I'm stuck with a day That's gray And lonely

Shrek:
(groans) Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?

His eyes opened up in realization.

Donkey's Voice:
(singing) I just stick out my chin, And grin, And say

Shrek:
Donkey!

He hit his head on the ceiling.

Shrek:
Ow!

Donkey's Voice:
(singing) Oh, the sun'll come out tomorrow So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow

Shrek:
Donkey, where am I? What’s happening?
Cage Witch #1:
(hits Shrek with her broom) Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.

Donkey:
(singing) But I made up my mind I'm keeping my baby Ooooh

Cage Witch #2:
Yeah, I’m driving, so I’m in charge of the music.

Donkey:
Will you witches make up your mind?

Donkey:
(singing) No matter what they take from me

Donkey and Witches: (singing) They can't take away
my dignity Because the greatest love of all

Shrek:
Donkey? What’s going on? Do you know where Fiona is?

(As the witches kept singing, Donkey quietly spoke to him.)

Donkey:
Quiet, ogre! You’re gonna get me in trouble and I need this job. I am not going back to
work for Old MacDonald. Tell me to E-I-E-I-O. "E-I-E-I-No!" That’s what I said.

Shrek:
Where are my babies? (as Donkey rolls his eyes) And where’s your wife, Dragon?

Donkey:
Look, I think you have me confused with some other talking donkey. I’ve never seen
you before in my life.

Shrek:
(puzzled) Never seen me before? Come on, Donkey!

Donkey:
And how do you know my name anyway?

Shrek:
It’s me, Shrek. Your best friend?

Donkey:
A donkey and an ogre friends? That’s the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!

As Donkey kept pulling the cage, Shrek fumed in frustration.

Shrek:
Can you at least tell me where they’re taking me?
Donkey:
To the same place they take every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.

Shrek:
Stiltskin!

Witch #1:
(hits Shrek with her broom) I said "quiet"!

(The second witch whipped Donkey again.)

Donkey:
(singing) Hit me with your best shot

(She gave him another lash.)

Donkey:
(singing) Why don't you hit me with your best shot

Donkey:
(singing) Hit me with your best shot

Shrek:
Oh, no.

Muffin Man's Voice: It’s time to crumble! Place your bets! Place your bets!

Muffin Man:
We start tout de suite!

Gingy:
Yeah!

Shrek:
(confused) Gingy?

Gingy:
Gingy snap!

(The spectators laughed, enjoying this sport. One of the certain dwarfs, who was one of
the spectators, saw the cage pulling Shrek.)

Dwarf:
(points at it) There’s one! Disgusting, filthy ogre!

All the villagers gathered around with nasty scowls, shouting and jeering at the ogre
prisoner.

Villagers:
(randomly) Hideous monster! Filthy, filthy creature! Disgusting creature!
Slavery Witch:
Move it!

Shrek:
(quietly) Don’t worry, Donkey. I’ll get us our lives back.

Donkey:
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard on mine, Captain Crazy!




                                         SCENE 5

Witch:
Mr. Stiltskin? You got another customer.

He took a sip from a cocktail drink, glancing at the customer with a wide smirk.
The customer was Pinocchio, who was being ushered through the VIP line by the witch.
He turned to Wolf, now dressed as a maid, next to a cart full of different wigs.

Rumpelstiltskin:
(snaps fingers) Wolfie!

Wolf:
(dryly) Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Bring me my business wig.

Pinocchio:
(pleading) Mr. Stiltskin, please!

Rumpelstiltskin:
(cutting him off) Abupupup!

(The miserable wolf placed a Victorian styled white powdered wig over the short man.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
(signals) OK, go.

Pinocchio:
Please make me a real boy!

(Rumpelstiltskin got out a rolled-up contract and smacked the wolf away.)

Rumpelstiltskin: (to Pinochio)
Go away! Terms are in the details, balsa boy.

Pinocchio:
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!
(The short man laughed as the puppet started signing.)

Shrek:(yells out) Stiltskin!

(Then all the music, dancing and talking stopped as all the witches turned towards the
ogre. The deal maker was excited as he stood up on his desk.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek! There he is!

(As he walked across the desk, he unknowingly knocked over the ink jar, spilling ink
over the spot where Pinocchio signed half his name in cursive.)

Pinocchio:
So close!

(The puppet's arm was grabbed by one of the witches and dragged away from the
table, without Rumpelstiltskin caring to notice.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
(extending out his arms) Have I been waiting for you!

(He hopped from the table and announced to all the witches.)
Ladies, this is the guy that made all of this possible!

(They all cheered wildly. Then the deal maker climbed up towards Shrek's
ear, pulling on it and speaking into it.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
So, tell me, how are you enjoying your day?

Shrek:
All right, Rumpel, what’s going on? What have you done?

He hopped off.

Rumpelstiltskin:
No, Shrek, it’s not what I’ve done. It’s what you’ve done. (skips to his table and sits on
it) Thanks to you, the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to me.

Shrek:
(rolls eyes) They would never do that.

Rumpelstiltskin:
They would if I promised them all their problems would disappear.

(Flashback)(Can be shown on the digital screen)

We see the same moment of Fiona's parents visiting the deal maker to sign
a contract to save their daughter, but this time, it has a different ending.
They signed their names, and then suddenly the king and queen began turning gold,
to their alarm and horror.
Rumpelstiltskin's Voice: And then THEY disappeared!

Queen Lillian:
No!

King Harold:
No!

They then started to fade away.

Both:
Noooooooo!

(The king and queen exploded into gold
dust, leaving only their crowns which dropped onto the table. The evil deal maker then
took Harold's crown.)

(End of Flashback)

(Rumpelstiltskin held out the deceased king's crown, as Shrek realized he
had tricked the king
and queen into signing the kingdom and their lives over. Rumpelstiltskin spun
the crown around as he sighed.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
They would have done anything if they thought it would end their daughter’s curse.

Shrek:
I ended Fiona’s curse!

Rumpelstiltskin:
How could you when you never existed?

(He kicked the crown away.)

Shrek:
You better start making sense, you dirty little man!

Rumpelstiltskin:
(pulls out contract from Shrek's vest) Here, let me spell it out for you! (points to fine
print) You gave me a day from your past, a day you couldn’t even remember. A day
when you were an innocent, mindless little baby.

(He walked away, mockingly humming "Happy Birthday", and that's when it dawned on
Shrek.)

Shrek:
You took the day I was born.

(The dictator held his toes before spreading his legs out.)
Rumpelstiltskin:
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.

Shrek:
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin, because when this day is up…

Rumpelstiltskin:
(interrupts) But you haven’t heard the best part.

(He snapped his fingers, and another witch brought over a huge magic hourglass to the
table, rerpesenting the remaining hours of the day.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Since you were never born, once this day comes to an end, so will you.

(The witches all laughed as Shrek saw the hourglass with the sand
running, which meant the time he had left was running.)

Shrek:
Where’s Fiona? Where’s my family?

Rumpelstiltskin:
Silly little ogre. You don’t get it, do you? You see, you were never born. You never met
Fiona. (menacingly) Your kids don’t exist.

(Then the witches all laughed at Shrek's misery, making the ogre more
upset. Rumpelstiltskin even taunted him some more.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Looks like you got exactly what you wanted! (mockingly) HAPPY OGRE DAY!!!!

(Shrek finally snapped and went for the short man.)

Shrek:
(furiously) Rumpel!!

(He lunged at Rumpelstiltskin, who yelped in alarm as he jumped back.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Get him, witches!

(A witch fired another skull chain at Shrek, but he sensed it was coming this time, so
he turned and blocked himself with the chains of his cuffs, just in time for
the skull to reach him. The skull chomped the chains, breaking them.
The witches screamed in alarm and panic as Shrek then ripped the shackles off his neck,
growling. Another witch flying on a broomstick was twirling a skull chain and firing it at
Shrek, but he quickly grabbed it and gave it a yank, pulling the witch down to his
level. Shrek and the witch were face-to-face, with the witch worried what he would do
to her.

Outside in the halls, Donkey was speaking to two witches, though it was hard to tell if
they were paying attention or ignoring.)
Donkey:
You know what’d help morale around here? Flip-flop Fridays.
Feet would be comfortable with the breeze on your toes.

(Then, without warning, the doors burst open and Shrek came flying through on
the broomstick he took, rather clumsily. He knocked the two witches and Donkey down
in the process, and at this time, "Click Click" by Light FM started playing. Shrek yelped a
bit as he rode a loop-de-loop. Donkey looked over the edge of the bridge he was on and
saw Shrek spiraling downward before trying to ride the broom on
the bottom story, though not doing very well.)

Witch:
Come on, girls!

(Five of the witches leaped off the bridge and onto their broomsticks, cackling madly as
they pursued the ogre throughout the floor. Through the
halls, Shrek still tried getting the hang of flying a broom as
the pumpkin witch chucked pumpkin bombs at him, but he luckily dodged each one.
Back on the top story, Rumpelstiltskin came out, angrily shoving one of the witches.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Lock all the doors, you worthless witches! (kicks a witch) Do it!

(The short man then saw Shrek flying up towards him with a stern look, making him
yelp. As the ogre on the broom zoomed upward, Rumpelstiltskin's wig briefly flew off his
head from the impact.)

Shrek:
(calls back) I’ll be right back, Donkey!

(He zoomed off, trying to figure out how to shake the witches.)

Donkey:
I don’t know you!

(He then looked back at Rumpelstiltskin.)

Donkey:
I don’t know him!

(The witches pursued Shrek through a higher story, and when he came to the edge and
saw a pole, he smirked, getting an idea. Once he came to the pole, he swung around it
and flew back, though rather lop-sided. When the witches saw
him swerving towards them, they all flew out of the way
to avoid getting hit. Shrek then managed to get a decent hold of the broom as
he zoomed back to the bottom floor, dodging more incoming pumpkin bombs. He came
back to
the floor where Rumpelstiltskin and Donkey were, stopped the broom and glared at the
foe.)
Donkey:
I’m glad I’m not you.

(The dictator ran off as Shrek then swooped in, but instead of going after the
deal maker who stole his birth, he scooped up Donkey in one swipe and flew
into another room, with Donkey screaming for help.)

Donkey:
Help me! Help!

(Shrek saw the skylight up above, and he smirked, getting an escape idea.)

Donkey:
Help!

Rumpelstiltskin:
No, not my pretty ball!

(The witches continued pursuing Shrek, with the ogre and donkey getting closer to the
skylight, with Donkey screaming and Shrek yelling.)

Shrek:
(covers Donkey's eyes) Watch out!

Rumpelstiltskin:
Wolfie? My angry wig.

Donkey:
Help! I’ve been kidnapped by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!

Shrek:
Donkey! Get off of me! Watch it with your pointy hooves!

(Then they ended up crashing through a tree, and
it looked like Donkey was riding the broom with Shrek holding onto the edge. Then, as
they crashed through another tree, and
it looked like Shrek was riding the broom backwards with Donkey riding on the bottom,
upside-down. Then, after crashing through another tree, the two ended up flying off
the broomstick and on the ground hard, with Shrek on his back and Donkey on the
ogre's stomach. Donkey then looked very worried, and then, the next thing you know,
he was running for his life with the ogre chasing after him.)

Donkey:
Just take my wallet!

Shrek:
Hey!

Donkey:
Animal cruelty! Help!
Shrek:
(covers Donkey's mouth) You need to calm down! I’m your friend.

Donkey:
(muffled) My friend?

Shrek:
I’m not gonna hurt you, all right?

He nodded, though in fear.

Shrek:
Good. I’m gonna let go…right…now.

(Once Shrek removed his hand, Donkey still panicked.)

Donkey:
Please! Eat my face last! Send my hooves to my mama!

Shrek:
Donkey! You’ve got to trust me.

Donkey:
Why should I trust you?

Shrek:
Because…because…

(He then thought of the only way to convince Donkey, but he shook his head,
not believing he was about to do it.) (sighs) OK.

(He got up and started to sing while dancing a bit, and wasn't particularly good
at carrying a tune.)

Shrek:
(singing) Winter, spring, summer, fall All you got to do is call And I'll be there, ye, ye, ye
You've got a friend

(Donkey then got up, with his look of fear fading away, and he began to grin warmly.
It looked like for a minute, Donkey recognized his best friend and
was about to embrace him but instead, he ran away, screaming some more. The ogre
was left dumbstruck.)

Shrek:
Fine! Go ahead! Run away! Who needs you?

Donkey's Voice:
I’ve never seen an ogre cry.

He turned and saw Donkey right next to him. He then wiped the tear away.
Shrek:
I’m not crying.

Donkey:
It’s nothing to be ashamed of. I cry all the time.

Shrek:
I said I’m not crying!

Donkey:
(recovers) Take it easy, I’m only trying to help. It’s none of my business why you’re
upset. By the way, why are you upset?

Shrek:
I was tricked into signing something I shouldn’t have.

Donkey:
You signed up for one of them time-shares, huh?

Shrek:
(pulls out contract) No. I signed this.

Donkey:
(gasps) You should never sign a contract with Rumpelstiltskin!

Shrek:
Yeah, I got that.

Donkey:
His fine print is crafty.

Shrek:
I know.

Donkey:
His exit clauses are sneaky.

Shrek:
Yeah, I...What did you say?

Donkey:
I’m talking about the exit clause. Used to be, you had to guess his name, but
now everybody knows who Rumpelstiltskin is.

Shrek:
Donkey, I’ve read the fine print. There’s nothing about an exit clause in here.

Donkey:
Well, you didn’t expect him to make it easy for you. Here, let me show you how it’s
done.
He grabbed the contract with his teeth and placed it on the ground, starting to fold the
paper.

Donkey:
I didn’t spend all that time around them witches without picking up a few tricks. Your
tiny, little ogre brain couldn’t begin to comprehend the complexity of
my polygonic foldability skills.

Shrek:
What are you doing?

Donkey:
Hey, I can’t get my origami on unless you back off. Thank you.

(Shrek rolled his eyes and sighed as Donkey continued folding.)

Shrek:
OK, here’s what you gotta do. You fold this piece here, make this letter match up
here, bring this corner here, and if you do it just right, it will show you what to do.

(Then Shrek saw that Donkey's paper folding started to from letters together to form
the exit clause. Once Donkey was finished, he showed the folded up paper to the ogre.)

Donkey:
There! "Try Lou’s Bliss. "

Shrek only gave a confused look.

Donkey:
Who’s Lou?

Shrek:
Give me that!

(He snatched the paper and did some folding himself, and then it showed a heart with
the TRUE words of the exit clause: "True Love's Kiss".)

Shrek:
"True Love’s Kiss. "

Donkey:
Hey, you have to take me to dinner first.

Shrek:
(rolls eyes) "According to fairy tale law, if not fully satisfied, true love’s kiss
will render this contract null and void." Donkey, you did it!

Shrek:
Look at you! If Fiona and I share true love’s kiss, I will get my life back!

Donkey:
(gets down) OK! This isn’t a petting zoo! So where is this Fiona?
Shrek:
Well, that’s just it, you see. I don’t know.

Donkey:
You know, when I lose something, I always try to retrace my steps. So, where did
you leave her last?

Shrek:
The last time I saw her, I told her I wished I’d never rescued her.

Shrek:
Oh, no.



                                          SCENE 6

(Shrek knew the only place to look was the place he first rescued her: the dragon's
keep, and that's where he went, with Donkey following. This time, there was no
lava surrounding the castle. Shrek ran across the bridge, hoping to find Fiona.)

Donkey:
Shrek? Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek! What, are you crazy? That’s the Dragon’s Keep!
They keep dragons in there!

Donkey:
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead! I’m gonna just hang back here and find us some breakfast!

Shrek:
Fiona!

(He looked and saw the bed where he first found Fiona deserted, and
the curtains and sheets were all ripped. That's not all he saw. He
saw something behind the tapestry of a knight on a steed. He went
over, pushing the tapestry aside, seeing markings on the stone wall. They were tallies of
all the days Fiona has been locked in the tower. Shrek tore the tapestry off, and
the whole wall was marked with tallies. Shrek put his hand on the wall in regret, and
then depressingly went over to the bed, and there he saw Fiona's princess tiara.)

Shrek:
Oh, no.
If I didn’t save Fiona…then who did?

(He then noticed another object on the ground, and that object was
the handkerchief Fiona gave Shrek on the day he rescued her. He picked it up and held
it as well. Soon, he returned from the castle, holding the handkerchief.)

Shrek:
This is the favour Fiona was supposed to give me on the day we met.

(Donkey looked surprised.)
Shrek:
It’s a symbol of our love. (pushes hankie in front of Donkey's face) Now smell it!

Donkey:
(winces) Hey, man, get that dirty favour out of my face!

Shrek:
Your nose is the only chance I have of tracking down my wife, so
stop complaining and start smelling. (waves it in front of Donkey) Smell it! Get it! Away
you go, girl!

Donkey:
Do I look like a bloodhound to you? In case you haven’t noticed, I’m a donkey, not a
dog! If I was a dog, they’d call me Dog, not Donkey! And another thing...

(Then he started sniffing.)

Donkey:
Wait a minute. I think I got something. Whatever it is, it’s sweet.

Shrek:
Fiona.

Donkey:
Luscious and tasty.

Shrek:
(frowns) Hey! That’s my wife you’re talking about.

(The donkey then abruptly rose his head up, and dashed off into the forest.)

Shrek:
Donkey!

(Donkey started sniffing the ground in the forest like a bloodhound, and to
his surprise and happiness, he saw
an unguarded plate of stacked waffles coated in syrup sitting on a stump.)

Donkey:
Yeah! Waffles! And I thought the Waffle Fairy was just a bedtime story. (rushes up to
plate) Sticky stacks of golden, syrupy deliciousness!

Shrek:
Donkey! Don’t eat that!

(Donkey stopped and frowned.)

Shrek:
There’s a stack of freshly made waffles in the middle of the forest. Don’t you find that a
wee bit suspicious?
Donkey only gave an "I don't know" kind of mumble before trying to take
a little nibble of the waffles, but Shrek kept protesting against it.

Shrek:
Oh, you…(as Donkey prepares to nibble) I’m just…What are you…? Bad Donkey!
Mustn’t--I said, don’t! Don’t! No! Get away from it.

(But Donkey extended his tongue out and licked the dripping syrup of the waffles.)

Shrek:
You did.

(Then, without warning, the plate flung the waffles onto a
tree. Donkey quickly realized it was a trap.)

Donkey:
Uh-oh.

The stump flipped open like a lid and looked at the hole, rather confused because it
didn't seem like an effective trap to him. However, that was not the full
trap. Shrek glanced around, seeing hidden pulleys and counterweights turning, and then
a log came swinging out to the direction of the two.)

Shrek:
(ducks) Look out!

But Donkey didn't duck in time, as he got hit in the end by the log, sending him into the
hole. The ogre ran up to the hole, lifting the lid, seeing Donkey lying there.

Shrek:
Donkey! Are you OK?

Donkey:
I’m fine.

(But then his hooves got snagged by a rope trap and he was yanked away, screaming.)

Shrek:
Donkey.

(He leaped into the hole and saw it led to a tunnel, and because it was small to walk
through, he had to crawl through it.)

Donkey's Voice:
Help! Help me! Help, Shrek! Help!

(Then he came out through the other end, pushing the roots, and when getting up, he
was awestruck at where he was. He was in some hidden camp with ogres like
him roaming about, carrying stuff and doing chores. He wandered around in
amazement, looking at the sights, making him grin a bit. A blacksmith ogre
was sharpening a tool and a female ogre was carrying an anvil of some sort.
As Shrek kept wandering, two ogres carrying a log were coming from behind him.)
Ogre #1:
Watch your head.

(He then ducked, letting the two ogres lift the log over him.
Then three ogres, including a female one named Gretched, came around him.)

Ogre #2:
Hey, it’s a new guy!

Ogre #3:
Look at him, all dressed up in his Sunday vest.

Gretched:
He’s really tiny, isn’t he?

Ogre #2:
Yeah.

(Then, a slender ogre taller than Shrek, known as Brogan, came behind our main
ogre, putting his arm around him.)

Brogan:
Fate has delivered us a comrade-in-arms and for that, we are thankful. Suit him up!

The other ogres then took Shrek to get suited up.

Ogre #3:
Let’s go, greenie.

Shrek:
Now, wait a minute!

(He was placed on an armor vest, along with some wrist bands, and a helmet. One
ogre smacked him in the rear to get him going.)

Shrek:
Hey!

Brogan:
Here you go.

(An axe was tossed into Shrek's
arms, which Shrek luckily caught. Three ogres each threw an axe
at three different dummies wearing witch's clothes. One ogre
even tackled a witch dummy, and brawled with it Shrek)

Brogan:
Welcome to the resistance.

Shrek:
(confused) Resistance?
Brogan:
(puts arm around Shrek) We fight for freedom and ogres everywhere!

(He then held his nose and started blowing a toot through his ears, and then, all
the other ogres held their noses and blew through their ears. When the blowing was
done, the resistance ogres hooted and laughed while Shrek was even
more stunned than already.)

Shrek:
I didn’t know we could do that.

(Suddenly, he heard a certain donkey yelling for help, and he turned to
see Donkey being carried upside-down by two ogres and tied to some sticks.)

Donkey:
Help! You can’t eat me! I got the mange! I’m poisonous! I’m all poi…

(But one of the ogres stuffed an apple in his mouth, resulting in Donkey to yell, muffled.
Then Shrek grabbed Donkey by the sticks.)

Shrek:
I’ll take him! This order’s to go.

One of the ogres carrying him, a chef ogre named Cookie then grabbed the sticks.

Cookie:
Hey! I haven’t removed his giblets yet.

Shrek:
Trust me, you don’t want to eat this one.

Donkey:
(spits out apple) I go down smooth, but come out fighting!

The two ogres ended up having a tug-of-war with Donkey.

Shrek:
Let go!

Cookie:
Don’t make Papa mad.

Shrek:
Your dinner is my friend!

Brogan came over, trying to break up the two.

Brogan:
Come on, guys!

Cookie:
I got to get the giblets out!
(Then, a horn was sounded, stopping the fight and getting all ogres' and Donkey's
attention.)

Ogre #4:
She’s back.

(Shrek turned and saw a figure arriving on the hill, who was clad with a helmet and
armor, and holding an axe in her hand. She removed her helmet, and revealed to be
none other than Fiona (in ogre form). She stood there, with the wind blowing her
hair, giving it a dramatic flare. When Shrek saw her, he grinned in so much relief.)

Shrek:
There she is. (hands axe to one of the ogres) Fiona!

(He began running up to Fiona, who noticed Shrek running up to her.)

Shrek:
I’m so happy I found you!

(Of course, because Shrek was never born, Fiona did not accept/return the embrace.
Instead, before Shrek could hug her, she lifted up her foot and kicked Shrek in the
face, sending him flying, yelling in slow-motion, before crashing to the ground.
The ogres winced while some couldn't help but chuckle a bit. The groaning Shrek got up
as Fiona walked up, handing her axe to Gretched, and her helmet to Brogan.)

Fiona:
Maybe you missed orientation, but for future reference, personal space is
very important to me.

Shrek then looked very worried.

Shrek:
You don’t know who I am, do you?

Fiona:
No. (to Brogan) Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away. Gather the others and meet
me in the war room.

Shrek:
Fiona.

Fiona:
Gretched, make sure everyone is prepared to move out tonight.

Shrek:
I need to talk to you.

Fiona:
What is it?

Shrek:
OK, I know you don’t remember me, but…we’re married.
(Needless to say, she gave a confused look.)

Shrek:
Hear me out. I was at the birthday party with some pigs and a puppet,
the villagers wanted me to sign their pitchforks, and this boy kept saying, "Do the roar.
Do the roar. Do the roar."

As he explained and tried making it sound as believable as he
could, Brogan and Gretched were equally as confused as Fiona.

Shrek:
Then I punched the cakes that the pigs ate and the next thing I knew, my donkey fell in
your waffle hole.

(Needless to say as well, pretty much all ogres that weren't Shrek,
were completely dumbstruck, and so was Donkey.)

Shrek:
Right? Who’s with me?

Fiona:
Wow, (chuckles a bit) I guess I must have kicked him harder than I thought.

(The ogres in the resistance laughed a bit.)

Shrek:
Fiona, I need to…

(But she held his hand up, as a lookout ogre was perched on a lookout, making "caw"
sounds.)

Fiona:
Witches! All right, everyone, you know the drill!

(She and the other ogres (except Shrek) went to their battle stations.)

Shrek:
Fiona!

Donkey:
Witches! Oh, no! Witches! Witches!

(Shrek grabbed Donkey and the sticks he was still attached to.)

Shrek:
Come on, now.

(Some of the ogres cut some ropes, closing up the big holes some ogres hid in just in
time, and dropping sand bags on fires, putting them out. The weapons were placed in a
net which was hoisted upwards, and then a couple ogres hid in a hole
underground, putting a cover over the hiding place.
Some other ogres, wearing rocks and plants on their heads, held their breaths as
they ducked down into some swamp water, and the remaining ogres (Fiona
and Brogan included) with bush disguises gathered around the spot where Shrek was
and crouched down. With that, every last ogre and the
camp itself was completely hidden from sight. Shrek covered the whimpering Donkey's
mouth, while the ogres looked up, and saw three of the witches flying up over
the forest on their brooms. The lead witch glanced down at the forest,
not finding any ogres or the camp, and gave a sneer. The witches then flew
off, retreating to Rumpelstiltskin's castle. Once they were gone, the ogres came
from their hiding place, murmuring while heading back to their posts.)

Brogan:
Fiona, that’s the third patrol today. We can’t hide forever.

Fiona:
Trust me, Brogan. After tonight, we won’t have to.

(Shrek and Donkey just sat where they were.)

Donkey:
That’s your wife?

Shrek:
That’s my wife.

Donkey:
Well, I see who wears the chain mail in your family!

The ogre gave a weird look at the donkey.

                                         SCENE 7

(Back at Rumpelstiltskin's palace, the dictator, not wearing any wigs, was staring at the
hour glass with the sands of Shrek's time running, and he gave a sigh.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Some people like to look at the goblet as--as half empty.

(He then turned to a table where some of his witches was sitting, and each had her
own cupcake.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Me, I like to look at it as half full. We’ve gone from the bottom to the top, ladies, but
we’re not just an empire, we’re a family. Everyone has got their cupcake? Cupcake?
Cupcake? Good. Yes? (to one of the witches) Baba?

(The witch named Baba nodded.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Good.

(He then walked around the table as he continued.)
Rumpelstiltskin:
Yeah, you know, we have put away a lot of ogres. And so one got away. Who cares? It’s
not a big deal. It doesn’t matter to me.

(One of the witches who was eating her cupcake, nodded in agreement.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
It’s not like it’s the end of the world. Except, funny thing...

(He motioned the witch he was near to help him upon top of the table and that's what
she did, and the villain began to rant.)

Now that I think about it, the ogre who got away is Shrek! (with frustration raising in his
voice) And if he shares a kiss with Fiona by sunrise, it IS the end of the
world! OUR world! MY EMPIRE!!

Fifi, resting nearby, honked loudly. Then Rumpelstiltskin exhaled, calming down a bit, as
he continued speaking more calmly, though his voice still had a hint of danger to it.

Rumpelstiltskin:
But, as I was saying, (takes pitcher of water and pours it into glass) I like to look at
the goblet as half full.

(The witches gasped and whimpered in fear, knowing that he might use it to melt any
one of them.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Yelling makes me so parched. Would anyone care for some water?

(He began to walk across the table and shove the glass of water in one of
the panicked witches' faces.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Wet your whistle?

(She shook her head 'no' in fear as he slyly walked over to another panicked witch.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...of aqua purificada?

(She nervously declined as well.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Anybody’s thirsty? Nobody’s thirsty? No? (puts pitcher down) Well, then
does anyone care to tell me what it’s going to take to get this ogre?!

(He narrowed his eyes and pointed to Broomsy Witch.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
You.
Broomsy Witch:
Faster brooms?

Rumpelstiltskin:
No!

Hat Witch:
(scared) Pointier hats?

Rumpelstiltskin:
No! (to another witch) You!

Witch:
Maybe we could hire a professional bounty hunter?

(He shouted and stomped his feet in frustration before splashing the water onto the
witch, melting her like a certain other witch.)

Witch:
(as she's melting) What a world! What a world!

(Soon, as the steam cleared and there was nothing left of that witch but a soggy pile of
her clothes. Then, Rumpelstiltskin pondered at the suggestion.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
You know, actually not a bad idea. (points to Baba) Baba!

Baba jumped out of her chair in fear.

Rumpelstiltskin:
I need a bounty hunter. And if music doth soothe the savage beast…(chortles evilly a
bit) then I think I might know just the person!

(PIPED PIPER IS INTRODUCED)

Griselda:
Mr. Stiltskin! He’s here.

Rumpelstiltskin sat back on his throne with a couple other witches at his side.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Nice.

The bounty hunter then came in through the doors, playing a flute, and he
was approaching the throne, but not using his arms and legs to do so. Instead, he used
a magic flute to make a small pack of mice carrying him all the way on their backs. Once
the bounty hunter was revealed in front of the dictator and witches, the
mice scampered off. He was in fact the Pied Piper.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Pied Piper. How was your commute?
Instead of speaking, the piper communicated by playing a few notes.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Good.

Griselda:
(scoffs) You call this guy a bounty hunter? What’s he gonna do,
(motions flute playing) flute those ogres a lullaby?

She and the other three witches chortled, while Rumpelstiltskin gave a nod to the piper,
who nodded back, and then he turned the setting on the end of his flute from mouse to
duck to witch. He then started playing a new song on the flute while beatboxing, and to
the surprise of the witches, Griselda's arms began moving by themselves. Then
she yelped as she started involuntarily breakdancing to the song, which is "Sure Shot"
by the Beastie Boys, and the other two witches involuntarily got up
and started dancing against their will as well, yelling in alarm.

Griselda:
OK, got it! Make it stop!

Rumpelstiltskin just laughed at this, enjoying it. The dancing and song lasted for a
bit, before the dictator got up, waving his arms.

Rumpelstiltskin:
All right, that’s enough.

With that, the witches' dancing halted, ending with involuntary dancer poses as
the three panted, and the piper ended his tune. Rumpelstiltskin gave an evil look.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Looks like it’s time to pay the piper.

The witches still stood where they were.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Griselda, seriously, it’s time to pay the piper. Now go get my checkbook!

The two witches left and Griselda got up to get the checkbook, but
the impatient Rumpelstiltskin kicked her rear.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Go! Move! Get out! Things are getting real sloppy around here!

The piper then switched the setting from witch to unicorn to his commissioned setting:
ogre.



He dipped his finger in the frosting of
the cupcake and licked the frosting right off, giving a malicious grin.
Back at the resistance camp, a meeting was being held inside a tree, with Shrek and
Donkey, who was untied, looking from the outside through some holes in the
trees. Shrek has gathered Brogan, Gretched, Cookie, and
some other ogres to discuss a battle plan, which was set out on a rock table,
with little model figures and everything.

Fiona:
Listen up, everyone. Word has come from Far Far Away. Stiltskin is leading tonight’s
ogre hunt himself.

The ogres started murmuring.

Ogres:
(randomly) He’s never done that before. What? Why?

Donkey:
I bet that’s because of us.

Shrek:
Shhh!

Brogan:
If that cupcake-eating clown finally leaves the safety of his filthy witch nest, he’ll be
vulnerable.

Fiona:
The plan’s simple.

She starts moving a model of the carriage with a couple witches along a path, with the
ogre models off to the side and Fiona's model on top of a cliff.

Fiona:
If they follow the usual patrol route, they’ll reach the river by midnight. We’ll
be concealed along this road, waiting for his caravan. Once they reach the clearing, I’ll
give the signal.

Fiona pressed the top of her model's head, making its arm raise up a sword it
had, which would be the signal.

Fiona:
And then we attack!

He raised her actual dagger and used it to slide the
ogre models toward the witch models, knocking the latter down and off the table.

Fiona:
And when the smoke clears…

Then she noticed a model of Cookie with some sort of wagon.

Fiona:
Wait, what’s this?
Cookie:
That’s my chimichanga stand.

Fiona:
No, Cookie. We won’t be needing that.

Cookie:
Trust me, Fiona. Y’all gonna be really hungry after this ambush, okay?

She only gave a small smirk, deciding to humor him.

Cookie:
Go ahead and finish your little speech.

Fiona:
All right, as I was saying, when the smoke clears, Rumpelstiltskin is gone and
the chimichangas have been eaten. Far Far Away will finally be free.

Brogan:
And so will we.

Fiona:
Spread the word. We move out as soon as Rumpel leaves the palace.

The other ogres chattered in
agreement, while outside, Shrek and Donkey looked concerned.

                                          SCENE 8

Donkey:
Man, this is serious!

Shrek:
(slumps back) Tell me about it. How am I ever gonna get her to kiss me before sunrise?

Donkey:
Actually, I was talking about the revolution.

Shrek: (scoff)
Revolution?

Donkey:
Why don’t you just tell her what you told me? About how you’re her true love and you
came from an alternate universe.

Shrek:
(sarcastically) Well, while I’m at it, why don’t I tell her that you’re married to a fire-
breathing dragon and you have little, mutant donkey-dragon babies.

Donkey:
I do?!
Shrek:
You saw what happened. She’s gonna think I’m crazy.

Donkey:
I’m a daddy?

Shrek:
You know what? If I got Fiona to kiss me once…

Shrek:
Then I can do it again.

Shrek started to head inside Fiona's tent. He peered his head inside.

Donkey:
Shrek, do my babies have hooves or talons?

Shrek:
Donkey! Hello? Fiona?

(He went inside with the frog balloon tied to a string attached to a small gift basket he
had. He looked around, seeing a shield and weapons hung up, and a play
tower/scratching post for cats. In fact, two familiar cat eyes appeared in the hole.)

Puss's Voice:
You should not be here, senior.

Shrek:
Puss?

(Suddenly, Puss's lower half started squeezing out,
only something was different about it: it was bigger and more round. The
cat grunted and squeezed out of the hole, finally revealing what he looked like in this
world: a tubby orange cat, currently wearing nothing but a bow around his neck.)

Shrek:
(frowns) You’ve gotta be kidding me.

(The orange cat slid down the scratching post very slowly and plopped onto
a purple pillow at the foot of the tower. He struggled a bit to get up, but
he eventually sat up and gave his usual glare towards foes.)

Puss:
Feed me, if you dare.

Shrek:
(sets basket down) Puss, what happened to you? You got so fa… Fa…fancy.

Puss:
Do I know you?
Shrek:
Well, where’s your hat? Where’s your belt? Your wee little boots?

Puss:
(gets off pillow) Boots? For a cat? Ha!

(He groaned while getting up and staggering toward some cream bottles and a bowl.)

Shrek:
But you’re Puss in Boots.

Puss:
(pops lid off bottle) Maybe once, but that is a name I have outgrown.

Shrek:
That’s not the only thing you’ve outgrown.

Puss:
( pours cream into bowl and sets the bottle down ) Hey! I may have let myself go
a little since retirement, but hanging up my sword was the best decision of my life. I
have all the cream I can drink and all the mice I can chase.

Shrek:
Puss, what have I done to you? You’ve gone soft.

Puss:
(yawns) Well, I do get brushed twice a day.

(He laid back in relaxation.)

Shrek:
Look, it’s not too late to fix it. All you have to do is help me get a kiss from Fiona.

(At this time, Fiona came back and was not happy to see Shrek inside her
tent without permission.)

Fiona:
What are you doing?

Shrek:
(turns around) Hey!

Fiona:
Can I help you with something?

Shrek:
Well, I know how stressful mounting a rebellion can be, rallying the
troops, planning attacks and all that, so I brought you a little something to ease the
tension.

(He held up the gift basket, but she didn't seem impressed.)
Fiona:
A gift basket?

Shrek:
You’re welcome. So let’s see what you got.

Shrek:
Heart-shaped box of slugs. A skunk-scented candle.

Shrek:
Mmm.

Fiona:
Look, this really isn’t the…

Shrek:
What’s this? (holds out a homemade coupon book) Coupons! Let’s see, "Good for one
free foot massage." "A mud facial!" Oh, and here’s one.

(He came to one that had a childish drawing of his face on it.)
"Good for one free kiss." Let’s cash it now.

Fiona:
Look, I don’t know what this is all about, but I’m trying to run a revolution.
So unless you have Rumpelstiltskin’s head in there, I suggest you take your gift basket,
get out of my tent and go make yourself useful! Wow.

Shrek:
Wow. You’re right. I am sorry. I was just trying to be friendly. (holds out hand) No hard
feelings?

Fiona decided to shake his hand.

Shrek:
An apologetic hug?

The two hugged.

Shrek:
And a quick kiss goodbye.

Fiona:
Hey!

(She quickly stopped him, grabbed his arm and placed it behind his back, forcing him to
leave.)

Shrek:
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?

He was then thrown out of the tent on his back before Donkey came to him with a grin.
Donkey:
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do they make people feel uncomfortable?

Back inside the tent,

Fiona:
Where’d we find that guy?

Puss, meanwhile, looked at his own reflection in the shield,
and thought about the little talk between him and Shrek.

Puss:
Could it be true? Have the years of prim and pampery made me soft?

Fiona then got out a comb and crush.

Fiona:
Don’t be silly. Now who’s a pretty kitty?

Puss:
(gives cute pose) I am.

Back at the palace, the three pigs were busy taking care of Fifi, and they
were disgusted with doing so. Heimlich was in charge of scrubbing the
goose's teeth (yes, goose don't normally have teeth, but this one does
apparently), Horst was in charge of trimming her toenails, and Dieter was
in charge of scrubbing her with a big soap brush and he plunged the brush into the suds
bowl in annoyance. Rumpelstiltskin came over to his giant pet and cuddled her by the
head.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.

He carressed her a bit, as she honked.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Honk.

He then turned to the pigs with a scowl.

Rumpelstiltskin:
All right, Piggies, be gone! Don’t forget to take her little potty box with you.

Dieter and Heimlich then carried the potty box away in disgust,
with Horst following and spraying some perfume to drown any odors. Fifi
then snipped Horst in the curly tail, making him yelp.

Horst:
(whines) This little piggy wants to go home!

When the pigs were gone, a witch named Griselda came running in.
Griselda:
Mr. Stiltskin! He’s here.

Rumpelstiltskin sat back on his throne with a couple other witches at his side.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Nice.

The bounty hunter then came in through the doors, playing a flute, and he
was approaching the throne, but not using his arms and legs to do so. Instead, he used
a magic flute to make a small pack of mice carrying him all the way on their backs. Once
the bounty hunter was revealed in front of the dictator and witches, the
mice scampered off. He was in fact the Pied Piper.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Pied Piper. How was your commute?

Instead of speaking, the piper communicated by playing a few notes.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Good.

Griselda:
(scoffs) You call this guy a bounty hunter? What’s he gonna do,
(motions flute playing) flute those ogres a lullaby?

She and the other three witches chortled, while Rumpelstiltskin gave a nod to the piper,
who nodded back, and then he turned the setting on the end of his flute from mouse to
duck to witch. He then started playing a new song on the flute while beatboxing, and to
the surprise of the witches, Griselda's arms began moving by themselves. Then
she yelped as she started involuntarily breakdancing to the song, which is "Sure Shot"
by the Beastie Boys, and the other two witches involuntarily got up
and started dancing against their will as well, yelling in alarm.

Griselda:
OK, got it! Make it stop!

Rumpelstiltskin just laughed at this, enjoying it. The dancing and song lasted for a
bit, before the dictator got up, waving his arms.

Rumpelstiltskin:
All right, that’s enough.

With that, the witches' dancing halted, ending with involuntary dancer poses as
the three panted, and the piper ended his tune. Rumpelstiltskin gave an evil look.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Looks like it’s time to pay the piper.

The witches still stood where they were.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Griselda, seriously, it’s time to pay the piper. Now go get my checkbook!

The two witches left and Griselda got up to get the checkbook, but
the impatient Rumpelstiltskin kicked her rear.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Go! Move! Get out! Things are getting real sloppy around here!

The piper then switched the setting from witch to unicorn to his commissioned setting:
ogre.

Back at the resistance camp, Shrek had been put to kitchen duties by Cookie. He was
now wearing a hair net (despite the fact he had no hair) and a
smock. Cookie handed Shrek a bowl of the usual food ogres eat.

Cookie:
Here, now make sure they eat up! You can’t end tyranny on an empty stomach!
(pushes Shrek out) Go on! (smacks him in the rear) Go!

So Shrek went to the other dining ogres as Cookie called out to them.

Cookie:
Din-din!

The ogres cheered, ready for some grub. Shrek poured some eyeballs into one ogre's
bowl. One other ogre slurped up a snake like
a spaghetti noodle, another ate cockroaches and onions straight off
a shish kabob stick, another chomped into a worm burger (with
some remaining roaches scattering all over him), and one more ogre slurped up
a whole string of snails attached together. Donkey was at one of the tables with the
ogres, surprisingly not as dinner but as a guest.

Ogre #5:
Come on, Donkey. One more time, please?

Donkey:
All right, but this is the last time.

Shrek stopped just to take a glance at what Donkey was
doing. Donkey dunked his snout into a bowl of eyeballs.

Brogan:
Here it comes. Look at him.

He raised his head back up, closed his eyes and then let out a
snort, causing two eyeballs (the ones from the bowl, not his own) to pop out of his
nostrils. Shrek yelped in surprise and disgust, but the other ogres, on the other hand,
all laughed heartily because they found the trick hilarious.

Donkey:
I see you! (wags his tongue) Ah la la la la!
The ogres (minus Shrek) continued laughing hysterically.

Donkey:
(singing) These eyes have seen a lot of loves But they're never gonna see another one
like I had with you

Brogan then spoke to Shrek.

Brogan:
That’s quite a friend you’ve got there. I can see why you haven’t eaten him.

Donkey:
(wags his tongue again) Ah la la la la!

Shrek chose this time to set down next to Donkey.

                                          SCENE 9

Shrek:
Donkey! (as Donkey opens his real eyes) I hate to pull you away from
your adoring public, but I’m not getting anywhere with Fiona.

Shrek then pulled the trick eyeballs out of Donkey's nostrils.

Shrek:
I need your help!

Cookie:
Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?

(Shrek saw that Cookie had one of his gifts for Fiona and threw it onto the table.
The ogres were eager for it as they chattered each wanting a piece of it, they took
everything, from the lid to the slugs inside. They even eagerly ripped the box
itself, leaving nothing but the heart-shaped base at the bottom, which was ripped in
half, looking ironically like a broken heart, to Shrek's dismay.)

Ogre #3:
Where’d you get these?

Cookie:
Fiona’s garbage. Just another gift from some clueless lover boy.

The ogres (minus Shrek) all laughed, and even Donkey couldn't help but giggle.

Donkey:
That’s a good one, Cookie!

Then he got a glare from Shrek, making him stop giggling.

Ogre #3:
Anyone who knows Fiona knows this stuff ain’t gonna work on her.
Gretched:
(takes one of the slugs and eats it) Works on me.

The resistance ogres laughed a bit some more.

Shrek:
Donkey, what am I gonna do? It’s like I don’t even know her.

Donkey:
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing Fiona cares about is her cause.

Brogan:
(raises fist) To the cause!

Ogres (minus Shrek): (raising their fists) To the cause!

They cheered a bit, before continuing their eating.

Donkey:
All right!

(Then Shrek had an epiphany, knowing the only way he could possibly get close to this
world's Fiona in order to save himself.)

(In Fiona's tent, the resistance leader herself was practicing witch-
striking while blindfolded, waiting for any witches to strike. )



Shrek:
(smirks) Nice moves.

Fiona:
(removes her blindfold) What are you doing?

Shrek:
What does it look like? I’m getting ready for ambush action. Oh, yeah. I always like to
quad my lutes and do some scrunches before an operational…op.

(He picked out a spiky tool from a nearby weapon bucket.)

Shrek:
This one taken?

Fiona:
We use that to clean the toilets.

(He got out another weapon.)

Fiona:
And we use that one to clean the thing we clean the toilets with.
Shrek:
I knew that.

(He then got out an axe.)

Fiona:
There you go, chief.

Fiona:
Hey, uh, Scott?

Shrek:
My name is Shrek, actually.

Fiona:
You’re going to get yourself killed at the ambush tonight.

Shrek:
(gets up) I’ll be fine. I think I can take care of myself.

Then, without warning, she threw a shield against him as a song began to play.

Fiona:
(smirks) Well, let’s see about that.

She then started to assault him with a huge hammer, which he used his shield to block.
This was some type of training.

SONG WITH FIONA AND SHREK

Shrek:
Hey!

Golden leaves looked brown to me

She continued trying to hit him as he blocked her with the shield.

Shrek:
Hey, hey! What the…?

The world had less color without you

He then spotted a spiky club lying on the ground. He took it used it
to attack Fiona back, hitting her shield hard and sending her down. She blocked herself,
and it appeared that she was whimpering, to Shrek's concern.

Shrek:
Fiona?

Of course, she was faking it as she got back up and smacked Shrek with her weapon.
Fiona:
Ha-ha!

Shapes in the sky look plain to my eyes

The two ogres then started attacking/blocking each other for a few
moments, until Fiona kicked Shrek to the wall, hitting a dummy with a gourd for a head.

The world had less color without you

Shrek got back up and hit Fiona's shield with his axe, then Fiona hit Shrek with a big
log, which he blocked with his shield. Then Shrek grabbed a huge mace
to strike Fiona with, which she blocked. Shrek was enjoying this practice, but then his
eyes widened upon seeing Fiona with a huge uprooted tree.
She whacked Shrek, sending him down, and both ogres laughed.

Without you

Shrek got out and the next thing you know, both ogres started punching each other.

I know plenty of people with eyes closed

They kept on punching until Shrek stopped Fiona's fists, with the two breathing as
they looked at each other. Puss was still watching and gave an amazed look at
the chemistry between the ogres.

They don't see you like I do Darling I do

Then one of the bracelets fell off Shrek's wrist.

Fiona:
I got it.

(She picked it up.)

Fiona:
Give me your hand.

He gave her his hand and she started to retie it onto his wrist.

Fiona:
The dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop and finally...

Shrek:
Into the castle.

(Fiona was surprised to find that Shrek knew the same tying rhyme as she did, and the
two then gazed at each other.)

Puss:
Wow.
Fiona:
OK. Good. It seems like you can handle yourself.

Shrek:
But, Fiona--

Fiona:
Now go get ready for the mission!

Shrek:
I will, but Fiona…

Fiona:
That’s an order!

Brogan:
All right, let's get those axes sharpened and weapons packed! Preparation is half the
battle!

Then, Puss began running after the dejected ogre, breathing heavily.

Puss:
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento! (pants) Ogre, ogre, un momento! Just give me a
minute.

Shrek:
Look, Puss, I'm a little pressed for time.

Puss:
I am not believing what I have just witnessed. Back there, you and Fiona. There was a
spark, a spark inside her heart I thought was long extinguished. It was as if, for one
moment, Fiona had actually found her true love!

Shrek:
I AM her true love. I ended her curse.

Hearing that surprised Puss.

Puss:
You know of her curse?

Puss gasped, stunned at the words Shrek said.

Puss:
You even know the little rhyme! It is true! You are the one! You must prove it to her!

Shrek:
How?

Puss:
Convince her! Go to her when she is alone and tell her something that only her true
love would know.
Then Donkey just popped up out of nowhere.

Donkey:
Know about what?!

The fat orange cat screeched from being startled, and hissed at the donkey.

Donkey:
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty! Shrek, can we keep him?

Shrek:
Excuse me. Coming through! Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.

Bringing up the rear, Puss, riding a small cart pulled by
Donkey, spotted Cookie's chimichanga cart up ahead.

Puss:
Look, Donkey, the chimichanga cart! Quick! (bouncing on Donkey's back)
Andale! After him, burro! Donkey, vmonos!

Donkey:
(annoyed) Man, you are a cat-astrophe!

Puss:
And you are ri-donkey-lous!

Then both shortly paused before they bursted out laughing,
not helping but finding both their puns funny. Then once the army came to the edge of
the forest, Fiona signaled them to stop.



                                        SCENE 10

At Rumpelstiltskin's castle, the gate opened with some of
the witches coming out, holding lanterns, followed by the carriage pulled by Fifi. At
this time, Fiona was leading the ogres, all clad in armor, through the forest to
be ready for the ambush. Shrek was trying to make his way through the ogre army
though.

Fiona:
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.

She went up ahead, and the other ogres, except Shrek obviously, went to
take positions to hide. Fiona saw a nearby hanging tree branch, grabbed it
and swung over it, landing on a higher hill.

Brogan:
Secure your positions!
(The ogres then climbed up some trees, and others donned disguises of bushes and
rocks, taking their hiding positions. Fiona then came to the top of
a slope where the carriage should be arriving. Shrek then appeared right beside her.)

Shrek:
It's quite a view from up here.

Fiona:
What are you doing?! Get back in position!

Shrek:
You need to know, once and for all, who I really am.

Fiona:
You are going to ruin everything!

Shrek:
Ruin everything? Actually, I'm gonna fix everything: the ogres, Rumpel, your curse.

Shrek:
By day, one way, by night another. This shall be the norm. Until you find true
love's first kiss, and then take love's true form.

(Flashback)

We see a flashback of Fiona, in her human form, in the tower, shedding some tears as
the sun was going down. She then laid down, and in a flash,
she magically transformed into her ogre form, as part of the spell, and she
lay there sorrowfully.

(Her eyes widened in shock, before she pulled out her dagger and held
it closely towards Shrek's chin.)

Fiona:
How do you know about my curse?!

Shrek:
OK, OK, please, Fiona. Just hear me out. I can explain everything.

(Meanwhile, because of Shrek distracting her, neither of the two saw the carriage and
witches, who were flying on their broomsticks, arriving this way.
The ogres were still awaiting Fiona's signal.)

Brogan:
Where's Fiona's signal?

Gretched:
What's she waiting for?

Cookie:
He's going to get away!
Brogan:
No, he's not.

He then gave a signal to one of the ogres in one of the trees. That ogre
nodded, pulling the rope, which two of the witches flew into, knocking them
off their brooms. The ogre army then yelled as they charged at the
carriage, taking down some more witches along the way, and
then ripping the carriage apart, chunk by chunk. However, to their surprise and
confusion, Rumpelstiltskin was not there. Then Fifi, who looked more wooden than real,
let out a flute-like squeak rather than a honk, to the ogres' notice. Then they saw "Fifi"
come apart, revealing to be the Pied Piper in a wooden Fifi disguise. He whipped out
his flute halves, placing them together, and beginning to play it.

Back with Shrek and Fiona, the latter threw the former down, threatening him with the
dagger.

Fiona:
Listen, I don't know who you are or how you know about my curse, but if any
of these ogres find out I'm...

Shrek:
A beautiful princess?

Fiona:
That is not who I am! Not anymore.

Shrek:
Look, I know you're upset.

Fiona:
You don't know anything about me.

Shrek:
I know everything about you. I know you sing so beautifully that birds explode.

Fiona:
Big deal.

Shrek:
I know that when you sign your name, you put a heart over the "I".

Fiona:
So what?

Shrek:
I know that when you see a shooting star, you cross your fingers on both
hands, squinch up your nose and you make a wish.

(Hearing that, her expression of anger faded away as she let him go. He got up as he
continued.)
Shrek:
I know that you don't like the covers wrapped around your feet, and I know that
you sleep by candlelight because every time you close your
eyes...you're afraid you're gonna wake up back in that tower.

(Fiona was amazed that he actually knew her more than she thought, and he looked at
her tenderly.)

Shrek:
But, most importantly, Fiona...I know that the reason you turn human every day
is because you've never been kissed....well...by me.

(The two then joined hands together, and suddenly, from the distance, flute music was
heard, and suddenly, Fiona grabbed the yelping Shrek, dipping him like in a dance.)

Shrek:
You move fast.

Fiona:
It's not me doing the moving.

PIPED PIPER AND THE OGRE DANCE LEADING THEM TO THE CASTLE

Then the two involuntarily got back up, holding their arms out. As the music picked up,
the two held each others' hands and started dancing away from the hill.

Fiona:
Why is this happening?!

Shrek:
Love?

Fiona:
No, I'm being forced to dance!

Shrek:
By love!

Fiona:
No, I can't stop myself!

Where the rest of the ogres were, they all began dancing unwillingly, as
the Piper was playing a flute-beatbox version of "Shake Your Groove Thing"
by Peaches & Herb. Brogan was panicking as he continued dancing under the flute's
power.

Brogan:
Please! Make it stop! I can't control myself!

Cookie, on the other hand, was getting jiggy with the dance spell.
Cookie:
Ooh yeah! Cookie's bringing the heat out of the kitchen!

He put his hand to his side, making a sizzle sound. Shrek and Fiona danced near the
ogre army, and ended up in the center of them, with Fiona spotting the Piper.

Fiona:
Oh, no! It's the Piper! I can't believe I let this happen, and it's all because of you!

Shrek:
If you'd just let me kiss you!

Fiona:
What? You're insane!

Then Shrek involuntarily picked up Fiona in his arms and tossed her the air, with
the ogres unwillingly tossing their shields up, giving some sort
of atmosphere with Fiona in the air. Fiona then landed back down in Shrek's arms, as all
the ogres continued dancing in a line and pointing their fingers like in
a disco dance, under the Piper's musical spell. Puss and Donkey, still unaffected by
the spell (because the setting was only to ogre), saw this and Puss
was concerned while Donkey was bobbing along to the flute-beatboxing.

Puss:
We must do something before they fandango themselves into oblivion!

Donkey:
What can we do?

Puss:
First, you must stop dancing!

Donkey:
When somebody tooties that fluty, I got to shake my booty!

Puss:
Then it's up to me!

He got out his claws and clawed Donkey's rear, making him scream and neigh like a
horse, oddly enough for some reason, as he began racing down the hill and toward the
line of dancing ogres. Donkey knocked Shrek and Fiona out of the line and onto the
cart, racing away. Despite them being away from the Piper, the
two ogres still pointed their fingers out like in a disco dance.

Puss:
Hurry! We must get them away from the music!

Donkey:
Puss and Donkey to the rescue! We saved the day!
Of course, he spoke too soon, as he didn't look to see they were heading for a chasm,
and he didn't stop at the edge in time, resulting in the four to be sent falling into the
chasm, screaming, before splashing into the water below.

A bit later, the four managed to reach dry land, recovering from the crash and
splash. Shrek tried to fit one of the bracelets back on one his wrists, and it
did because it didn't rust when hitting the
water. Fiona just sighed in annoyance however. Puss tried to lick himself clean, but due
to his ball-like girth, he could not reach his back half. He then turned to
the drenched donkey, who was licking himself.

Puss:
Donkey, can I borrow your tongue?

Donkey:
(stops licking himself) Say what?! Nuh-uh! No. Hell...

The orange fat cat started doing his 'big eyes' trick.

Donkey:
I don't care how big your eyes get, player, it's not going down.

His eyes grew even bigger, until the groaning Donkey finally gave in.

Donkey:
(in defeat) All right!

Donkey took a deep breath and stuck his tongue out, ready to lick the cat, though he
was disgusted to do so.

Shrek:
Stop!

He saw Fiona heading up the path to a bridge and holding the lantern,
with Shrek following.

Shrek:
Where are you going?

Fiona:
To save my friends.

Shrek:
How? By getting yourself killed?

Fiona:
If that's what it takes.

Shrek:
Puss, say something.
Fiona:
(turns) Puss?

Puss:
(stammers) Let me explain.

Fiona:
That's how you knew so much about me.

She continued to storm away and cross the bridge above.

Shrek:
(hops onto the bridge) Fiona, wait! Kiss me.

Fiona:
What?

Shrek:
It's the only way to save your friends.

Fiona:
(shoves him) Get out of my way.

Shrek:
You used to believe that a single kiss could solve everything!

The female ogre then stopped in her tracks and turned, thinking that he would not be
able to take a hint any other way. So he went up towards him, grabbed him and gave
him a kiss, and the night background changed to a glowing background of yellow, and
for a minute, it looked like everything would revert to normal, but alas, it did not. When
the kiss ended and Shrek opened his eyes, everything about the alternate world was all
as it was, including Fiona, frowning bitterly as she wiped her lip. Even Puss
and Donkey were puzzled at how everything was the same.

Shrek:
I don't understand. This doesn't make any sense. True love's kiss was supposed to fix
everything!

Fiona:
Yeah, you know, that's what they told me, too. True love didn't get me out of that
tower. I did. I saved myself. Don't you get it? It's all just a big fairy tale.

Shrek:
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!

Fiona:
How would you know? Did you grow up locked away in a dragon's keep? Did you live
all alone in a miserable tower? Did you cry yourself to sleep every night, waiting for a
true love that never came?!

Shrek:
But...but I'M your true love.
Fiona:
Then where were you when I needed you?

She then picked up her lantern, leaving the three alone on the bridge,
to rescue her friends herself. Shrek just stood there, completely heartbroken, knowing n
ow that all his chances of ever getting a kiss from Fiona and saving his own life are
gone.

Donkey:
Maybe you kissed her wrong?

Shrek:
(sadly) No. The kiss didn't work...because Fiona doesn't love me.



                                        SCENE 11

Inside the castle, all the ogres were yelling as they were now in cages dangling from the
ceiling.

Brogan:
Don't despair, fellow ogres! They can put us in cages, but they can't cage our honour!

Down below, the Piper was flute-speaking frantically to Rumpelstiltskin, explaining the
situation, and the villain was furious.

Rumpelstiltskin:
(furiously) SHREK AND FIONA ARE TOGETHER?!

He frantically flute-spoke some more.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Yeah, I've heard enough of your (stomping his feet in rage) toot-a-lee-
toots! YOU BLEW IT!

He then turned to Wolf.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Wolfie! My speech wig. (to Baba) Baba!

She squeaked, stammered and stood up straight.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Ready my makeup. (to the Piper) And Piper, pull my socks up.

He set the setting to socks and played his flute so
Rumpelstiltskin's socks could be slithered up his legs tight like magic.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Wee tight.
(Then, somewhere in a market place, the Magic Mirror's face appeared in
a mirror hanging in a shop (along with other mirrors pretty much anywhere in the
kingdom).

Magic Mirror:
Attention, citizens.

(Some citizens, including the Muffin Man and one of the dwarves, who was digging in
a trash barrell for scraps, turned their attention to the mirror in the shop.)

Magic Mirror:
Please stay tuned for a message from our tyrannical dictator!

(The mirror's face disappeared and then there stood Rumpelstiltskin,
in another powdered wig, in front of a beachside sunset background.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
(speaking gentle-like) Hello, people. (doing a curtsey) It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...shepherd
of your dreams.

We then see him in a fake fern field, helping a little bird (which was also fake,
obviously) fly away. When watching this, one citizen coughed.
Next, Rumpelstiltskin slid backwards down a rainbow while on his back.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Recently, a certain somebody has jeopardized our joyous lives.

The scenery changed to a fiery background.

Rumpelstiltskin:
(angrily) And that somebody is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!

On mentioning the name, a picture of Shrek with Donkey appeared right next to him.
Then, the scene changed to a scenery of angels behind him.

Rumpelstiltskin:
(calmly again) That is why I come to you, dear citizens. For whomever brings me this
ogre, shall receive the deal of a lifetime.

He waved his hands, and a contract labeled "Deal of a Lifetime" appeared in front of
him. Then, as "Orinoco Flow" by Enya played in the
background, Rumpelstiltskin appeared on top of a mountain.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Just think of it! Total and complete happiness.

Heimlich:
Ja!

(We now see the dictator's head spinning with gold coins raining in the background.)
Rumpelstiltskin:
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment! All your greatest wishes.

Gingy and his animal crackers saw this on the mirror, and the gingerbread man
was interested as well.

Gingy:
(breaks his candy cane in half) Yeah!

The deal maker appeared, sitting on a goose's back, next to a beachside.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Your wildest dreams.

Next, he was in front of a painting of his castle with fireworks shooting.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Anything you could ever want! No strings attached!

Pinocchio, who was tangled upside-down in ropes and
sleeping, heard this commercial and was interested as well.

Pinocchio:
Ooooh.

Then, the dictator appeared next to a big hourglass.

Rumpelstiltskin:
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.

The final scenery we see is Rumpelstiltskin's angry face in front of a painting of
a burning city.

Rumpelstiltskin:
So light your torches, sharpen your pitchforks and get your mob on!

The message got through to all citizens of Far Far Away as they all
got their pitchforks and torches and began storming through the kingdom to hunt down
Shrek, capture him and get their reward.

Mob:
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

Mob Member:
Go back where you came from!

The mob passed a brick wall. If they had stayed a little longer, they would have seen
Shrek, Donkey, and Puss come out of hiding.

Puss:
It seems that we are safe.
Donkey:
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky and torchy out there. Let's go.

Shrek:
What's the point? The kiss didn't work. It's over.

Donkey:
Look, Shrek, I know things might seem a little bleak right now,
but things always work themselves out in the end, you'll see.

The ogre slapped his forehead.

Donkey:
I bet by this time tomorrow...

He couldn't hold it in any longer, so he finally started to shout.

Shrek:
Don't you understand? There is no tomorrow. There's no day after that, and there's no
day after THAT day after that! My life was perfect and I'm never going to get it back!

Donkey:
If your life was so perfect, why'd you sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?

Shrek:
Because I didn't know what I had until it was gone! All right?

He sighed sadly.

Shrek:
I didn't know what I had.

He looked like he was about to cry, but then he felt something and heard tiny shouting.
He looked down and saw Gingy hitting and attacking his feet with his lollipop.

Gingy:
Ha! Chah! Surrender now! I'm taking you in!

Of course, Shrek was not affected by this at all. He just stood there with a dry look
as Gingy kept attacking and shouting.

Gingy:
Don't try to fight it, ogre! The reward is mine!

Shrek:
Gingy?

He picked the gingerbread man up.

Gingy:
You unhand me, green devil!
Shrek:
What are you doing?

Gingy:
Collecting my bounty!

Puss:
Bounty?

Donkey:
What are you talking about, cracker?

Gingy:
Rumpelstiltskin promised the deal of a lifetime for whoever could bring you in.

Shrek:
Deal of a lifetime?

Gingy:
(down) Where all your wishes come true.

The ogre pondered this for a bit.

Shrek:
Wait a minute. (grins) I can still fix this.

Donkey:
Now, how you gonna do that?

He then set Gingy down.

Shrek:
You know what? I'm gonna give Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants. (turns to Gingy)
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...

(But to his surprise, there were only crumbs and a gumdrop button on the ground.
He looked and saw Puss eating something, and it was apparently Gingy. The
cat noticed the ogre looking at him, and gave a sheepish look.)

Puss:
Were you going to eat that?

(Inside the castle, the citizens came with prisoners of theirs, and none of them were
Shrek, as the dictator pointed out while pacing and inspecting each one.
One citizen even brought in a bag of flour with a scary green face painted on it.)

Rumpelstiltskin:
Not Shrek! That is not Shrek! Also not Shrek!

He then saw Butter Pants and his father with a big green creature they captured.
Rumpelstiltskin:
That's not even an ogre, it is a troll! Nice try. (sees next one) And that...

(What he saw was Wolf wearing a Shrek head over his own, claiming to be captured by
the pigs.)

Wolf:
(dryly) Roar.

Rumpelstiltskin:
...is just sad.

He then spotted Pinocchio with his father, dressed in Shrek's clothes and fake ogre ears,
with his face painted green and hands tied by a rope that the puppet was holding.

Rumpelstiltskin:
And what is that supposed to be?

Gepetto:
I'm just a frightened old man.

Pinocchio:
Don't listen to him! These ogres are crafty!

Rumpelstiltskin:
That is your father painted green.

Pinocchio:
No, it's Shrek! Honest!

Then his nose grew and hit Rumpelstiltskin in the face, making the deal maker shout in
pain as he swatted it out of his face.

Rumpelstiltskin:
(to a witch) Take them away!

The frustrated villain then went to his table.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Can no one bring me Shrek?! Where is he? How hard can it be?!

He angrily pounded on his table like a two-year-old.

Rumpelstiltskin:
I WANT HIM! I WANT HIM! I WANT HIM!

Then the door of the throne room slammed open, and the ogre he wants is there.

Shrek:
Stiltskin!

Rumpelstiltskin jumped up and looked back, seeing Shrek wander through the aisles.
Shrek:
I hear you're looking for me.

Rumpelstiltskin:
All right! Finally! (calls out and looks around) Who turned him in? Who gets the deal of a
lifetime?

Shrek:
I do.

He took the 'deal of a lifetime' contract out of Rumpelstiltskin's hand.

Rumpelstiltskin:
What? But--

Shrek:
If I'm turning myself in, I get the deal of a lifetime.

He plucked a feather from Fifi and dipped in the magic ink jar.

Shrek:
That means you have to give me anything I want.

The scared villain leaped onto the table, stopping him signing it.

Rumpelstiltskin:
No, no, no! Only true love's kiss can break your contract! So if you thought you were
just gonna (mimicks walking) doot-doot-doot in here and get your life back--

Shrek:
I'm not here to get my life back.

Rumpelstiltskin:
(with a glare) Then what DO you want?

(Outside the castle, Donkey and Puss awaited before all ogres of
the resistance magically appeared, one by one, an dropped from the
sky. Donkey saw Gretched falling towards where Puss was, so he used his teeth to pull
the cat out of the way.)

Puss:
The ogres. They are all free.

Of course, Donkey noticed that not ALL of them were free.

Donkey:
But where is Shrek?

They all went up to the gates, knowing Shrek was still inside.

Puss:
This is not good.
Back in the throne room, the villagers have left, and Rumpelstiltskin was leading Shrek,
who had his hands shackled, to a dungeon room, with
four witches encircling the prisoner and pointing their brooms at him.

Rumpelstiltskin:
I don't know. Not much of a storybook ending. (mockingly)
The noble Shrek turns himself in to save a bunch of filthy ogres.

Shrek:
All that matters is that they're free, and Fiona is safe.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Awww, I bet Fiona would be really touched to hear that, but, hey, I guess you can tell
her yourself.

He and the cackling witches turned to reveal Fiona, shackled as well, struggling to get
out.

Shrek:
Fiona!

Both ogres rushed to each other, but the weight of the shackles and chains held them
back. They tried breaking free from them to no avail,
and Rumpelstiltskin only cackled maniacally as he watched the
two ogres struggle to reach each other in failed attempts to his
pure wicked amusement.

Shrek:
Stiltskin, we had a deal! You agreed to free all ogres!

Rumpelstiltskin:
(uncaring tone) Oh, yeah. (slyly) But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?

He gave a smug, evil smirk. Shrek's face faltered as he looked over at Fiona worryingly.

Rumpelstiltskin:
By day, one way, by night, another. Blardy, blardy, blar. Ha ha!

He skipped merrily out of the room in triumph.

Rumpelstiltskin:
(triumphantly) Nobody's smart but me!

He and the laughing witches left the room, closing the doors and leaving the
two prisoners alone. Shrek gave a solemn sad look.

Fiona:
That was a really brave thing you did, Shrek. Thank you.

Shrek:
No, you were right. I wasn't there for you. And not just at the Dragon's Keep,
but...every day since.
Fiona:
Well...(gives a small sad smile) you're here now.

Outside, Donkey was determined to get inside, but Gretched held him back by the tail.

Donkey:
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!

Gretched:
Don't be a fool, mule!

Brogan:
She's right. Rumpel's palace is locked up tighter than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.

Cookie:
And that cupboard wasn't guarded by a whole bunch of mean, ugly, nasty witches.

Of course, two witches guarding the palace from above, heard them.

Palace Witch #1:
Hey! We can hear you!

Brogan:
Sorry!

Then the ogres, Donkey and Puss huddled.

Puss:
We must get into the palace.

Donkey:
Man, Shrek and me just busted out of that place!

Brogan:
But how?

Donkey then saw a shield, and it gave him an idea.

Donkey:
The same way we're gonna bust in.

The group huddled in closer together, with the
two palace guard witches curious, wondering what they're talking about. A while later,
Rumpelstiltskin, with his speech wig back on for some reason (though
it looked untidy), walked back in the throne room, as a witch was hoisting up
what appeared to be a new big decorative ball like the one from earlier.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Yay! My new pretty ball!

He noticed that something about this ball was different than the previous one.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue? I guess it'll have to do.

Once the witches got it up, some other witches poured magic glowing dust
in their cauldrons, causing bright, glowing, blue and pink lights to appear.
They pointed their cauldrons like spotlights at the big
ball, which began reflecting the bright colorful lights off like a disco ball.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Witches, finally, the moment we've all been waiting for. The main event of the evening!

The floors under him began shifting, revealing something. It
was Shrek and Fiona still bound in shackles and chained to the walls, with
a spotlight shining down on them.

Rumpelstiltskin:
I present Shrek and Fiona!
And now, to put the past behind us once and for all, I give ya a
princess's worst nightmare! Fiona's old flame, the keeper of the keep...

As he continued speaking, Shrek and Fiona saw a gate in the dungeon opening up and
a familiar red dragon stormed in.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Dragon!

She let out a huge roar and then started breathing fire.
She stomped about, getting ready to finish her prisoners as Rumpelstiltskin laughed hea
rtlessly, enjoying the ogres' soon-to-be demise. Then suddenly he and
the witches heard a familiar voice singing from out of nowhere.

Donkey's Voice:
(singing) Winter, spring, summer, or fall

They all gasped, looking up at the big ball, seeing Donkey at the top of it, singing.

Donkey:
(singing) All you got to do is call And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah

Dragon, who was nearing Shrek, turned her attention up to the ball.

Shrek:
Donkey?

Donkey:
And Puss!

On cue, though very slowly, Puss slid down the rope holding the ball, and this time, he
was wearing his hat, cape and boots.

Puss:
In Boots!
He tap danced a bit on top of the ball, and then from inside it, a humming noise was
heard, to the witches' and Rumpelstiltskin's concern.

Rumpelstiltskin:
What?

They all looked around to see where the noise was coming from, and the new
ball suddenly broke open like a pinata and all the resistance ogres began flying out of it,
yelling. The whole thing turned out to be a Trojan horse reenactment with
the ogres using their shields to make it convincing. All the witches screamed as
the ogres chased after them with their clubs and
weapons, ready to clobber them. Brogan leaped out towards where Rumpelstiltskin was,
making the dictator scream as he ran for it. Brogan rose his club, ready to strike the
villain, but one of the witches flew by on her broomstick, scooping up
her master and taking him to the higher balcony, dropping him
there. Rumpelstiltskin jumped onto the railing and looked down at the chaos in horror.
Puss and Donkey meanwhile saw Dragon returning her attention to the
ogres, snarling like mad and ready to attack again, but Puss then cut the rope of
the platform he and Donkey were on, sending them falling and screaming, but
they landed on Dragon's head, knocking her down for the count.
Rumpelstiltskin, still watching, grumbled and growled.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Get them! Get them, witches!

So the witches on the balcony got out their pumpkin bombs and chucked them down
to where all the resistance ogres were. They luckily saw the pumpkins about to be
thrown.

Ogre:
Incoming!

They all took their shields and blocked themselves with them, with
the exploding pumpkins bouncing off and not blowing up one single ogre.
The woozy Donkey got up on his legs.

Shrek:
Donkey, woo her!

Donkey:
Woo who?

Shrek:
Your wife!

Speaking of whom, Dragon growled as she stomped behind the fear-stricken Donkey.
He timidly turned, screaming a bit. Then suddenly the lights changed to blue as
Donkey's fearful expression changed to a smooth charmer expression, with
the donkey trying his best to woo the reptile, who's look of anger began to fade, as if
the charm was working. Donkey then gave a grin,
and Dragon batted her eyelashes lovingly. At this time, a certain Lionel Richie song
played.

Hello Is it me you're looking for I can see it in your eyes

The two were about to kiss until Dragon's mouth opened wide around Donkey.

Donkey:
Uh oh.

Then in one chomp, Donkey ended up in her mouth. Puss then leaped onto the dragon's
spine, grabbed his sword and jabbed it right into the back, making the dragon roar and
spit out Donkey, who was sent flying in the air.

Donkey:
Wahoo!

He hitched a ride onto a passing witch's broomstick.

Donkey:
(calls out to Dragon) I'll call you! (to the witch) We're in love!

Witch:
Good for you.

Back below, the dragon spotted the fat cat and just as she tried to eat him,
he leaped out of the way, shouting in excitement. He rode her
tail, which she swished around like mad, hitting a wall where Shrek was, and the
ogre ducked in time. Then Dragon flicked the screeching fat cat off her tail,
and Fiona caught him in her arms. Fiona gasped, knowing Dragon was coming for
them, so she turned away, getting ready for the blow
and Dragon exhaled the biggest breath of flame from her
mouth. After she breathed it, she then saw that Fiona and Puss were no longer there,
then she spotted the ogre being lifted up by the chains, thanks to Shrek pulling on
the chains with his wrists, and Puss was holding onto Fiona's back.

Shrek:
Fiona, hold on! (to Dragon) Hey, you!

He then got Dragon chasing after him as he continued pulling on the chains.

Shrek:
Whoa!

Then Shrek and Fiona ended up swinging around on both chains all around the room,
and each time they got near Dragon's mouth, she tried to eat them, only to miss. Then
both ogres each reached a dangling cage. Shrek reached out his hand,
and Fiona swung a bit, taking his hand. Back
above, witches kept launching skull chains at the ogres, pulling them
up, though no matter how many skull chains ensnared Brogan, he did his best to resist.
He even grabbed some of the chains and tossed some of the witches who had them
down. Then, on the balcony, the short villain saw chimichangas being fired at some of
the witches near him.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Chimichangas?!

Down below, Cookie was launching the aforementioned sticky foods from his
cart/catapult.

Cookie:
Get 'em while they're hot!

He even launched one at the witch that Donkey was riding with. When
the witch was knocked down by the snack, Donkey was impressed. Below in the
dungeon, Shrek and Fiona made it the top of the middle dangling cage.
They looked down, waiting for Dragon to leap out at them, and when she did, that
was their chance.

Fiona:
Jump!

They both leaped onto the separate cages, while Dragon got her snout stuck in
the middle cage. They looked at each other while holding their chains.

Shrek:
Now!

They both leaped off the cages, and started swinging around Dragon like acrobats.

Fiona:
Woo-hoo!

As Dragon kept struggling to get the cage off her muzzle, the
two ogres began wrapping the chains around the reptile, starting with her tail.

Shrek:
The dragon goes under the bridge!

Fiona:
Through the loop!

Shrek:
And finally...

They then both reached the center of the dragon's back, finishing trussing her in chains.

Both:
Into the castle!

They both tugged on the chains, and Dragon, bound in them, was sent tumbling down.
Then Shrek and Fiona looked at the battle still going on above.
The witches were screaming as the ogres were getting the better of them.
Palace Witch:
Run!

Some witches ran and flew off on their brooms, screaming. On the
balcony, Rumpelstiltskin saw that ogres were closing in on both sides where he
was, giving him nowhere to run. He then made for the balcony's railing as the ogres had
him cornered. He turned back towards them.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Foo!

With that, he leaped off backwards, to the ogres' shock. Then they
were surprised further to see the short foe riding on Fifi, who was flying upwards so
they could make their escape.

Rumpelstiltskin:
So long!

He laughed tauntingly as Fifi headed for the skylight, as dawn was approaching, but
then a skull chain had snagged Fifi's leg, and Shrek was the one who was holding the
chain.

Shrek:
Ha ha ha!

Fiona and Shrek grabbed hold of each other.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Come on, Fifi, go! Go!

Fifi tried to keep flying, pulling Shrek and Fiona out of the dungeon.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Witches, close up the floor!

The floor began closing up, but Shrek and Fiona were pulled out just in time. Fifi tried to
keep flying even though it was harder with the chain around her leg.

Rumpelstiltskin:
(fussing) Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap! Come on, go! Fly away! Up, up! Go!

The smirking Shrek pulled the chain, causing Rumpelstiltskin to loose his grip on his
goose, as he was sent falling and screaming.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Fifi, no!

His fall was stopped when a glaring Fiona caught him, making him give
a scared sound. Fiona then held up the short man like a trophy.

Fiona:
Victory is ours!
All the ogres shouted and cheered in
triumph, while raising their weapons. Donkey then started tapping his hooves with
Puss doing a little victory tap dance, until at the end when the top of his boots began to
split, to the fat cat's embarassment. Cookie then carried off
the worried and defeated villain in his arm, as he and Brogan gave smirks towards him.

Brogan:
Looks like we're having curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

When all was settled, Fiona and Shrek looked to each other.

Fiona:
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

Shrek:
You have no idea.

The two then looked at each other, staying silent for a moment, but
then Shrek noticed something serious. His hand was started to give
a bright yellow glow, making him gasp. He saw that morning was starting to happen, so
that meant he was beginning to fade away. His legs also started glowing as he fell
down.

Fiona:
Shrek?

She held him up. They saw the magic hourglass of Shrek's life was almost out of sand,
to Rumpelstiltskin's delight.

Rumpelstiltskin:
His day is up. His day is...!

But Cookie squeezed him, making the villain gag.

Fiona:
Shrek?

Shrek:
It's all right.

The ogres, Donkey and Puss watched on sadly.

Fiona:
There has to be something I can do.

Shrek:
You've already done everything for me, Fiona. You gave me a home and a family.

Fiona:
You have kids?
Shrek:
We have kids. Fergus, Farkle and a little girl named...

Both:
Felicia.

Fiona:
I always wanted to have a daughter named Felicia.

Shrek:
And someday...

The fading ogre then dug in his pocket and pulled out
the squeaky toy belonging to their daughter.

Shrek:
...you will.

He handed it to her, and she looked at it sadly, before looking back towards him.

Shrek:
You know what the best part of today was? I got the chance to fall in love with you all
over again.

Tears began to form from Fiona's eyes as she leaned her head towards Shrek's face.
The hour glass emptied and the light began to glow brightly all around Shrek's body
as Fiona kissed him deeply, and then Shrek began to fade away
into nothing but sparkles of golden dust that also began to fade away as Fiona held him.
It seemed Shrek was no more. Then the
sun rising behind Fiona began to shine brightly, illuminating the whole room as she
sat there on her knees with tears running down her face, which was still green, to Puss's
notice.

Puss:
Fiona, the sunrise! You're still...an ogre!

Fiona:
True love's form.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Impossible!

Fiona:
The kiss worked.

Suddenly the wind began blasting and brushing by everyone, also knocking Puss's hat
off his head. Everyone looked up and saw
the magic golden light that brought Shrek here begin to eat away at
Rumpelstiltskin's castle like mad. All bricks, shingles and other material of
the castle were sucked away in a magical tornado.
Rumpelstiltskin:
What?!

Then, one by one, each witch and ogre began to puff away
into puffs of yellow smoke. Cookie and Brogan quickly vanished, dropping Rumpelstiltski
n, and he then saw Fifi vanish in a puff of smoke as well.

Rumpelstiltskin:
Fifi!

Then Donkey and Puss were the next to vanish.

Fiona:
Puss!

Then Fiona vanished next. The horrified Rumpelstiltskin, the only one
remaining, twisted in circles in place while shouting in alarm as
his whole world around him was tearing away and disappearing.

Rumpelstiltskin:
No, no, no! No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!

Then the floor under him, the only thing remaining, crackled away and
he began falling down into an abyss of pure golden light while screaming out loud in
horror, before everything went black for him.

                                        SCENE 12

The world changed back to a different world where Shrek was giving his big, loud
ogre roar from before.

Shrek:
RRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!!!!!

Once he was done, he panted and saw where he was. He was back in his
own original world and at his kids' birthday party, as if he never left it. It was as if
the magic of true love's kiss reversed everything to the event where he roared. He saw
that everyone else in the Candy Apple was left stunned and silent for a bit until they all
cheered.

Butterpants:
(chuckles as he hugs his dad) I love you, daddy.

As everyone began chanting Shrek's name, the ogre began to smile, happy to have his
life back, and everyone he knew back to normal.

Everyone:
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

Gingy saw one of the Three Blind Mice facing the other way so
he turned the mouse around correctly.
Wolf then slapped a party hat onto Shrek's head.

Puss:
Everybody, I have found...

He lifted his cape to reveal another cake decorated like the last one.

Puss:
(finishes) another cake!

Fiona:
Shrek? Are you OK?

He turned to see Fiona, the way she was before signing his life away.
He removed the party hat and went up to hug his wife.

Shrek:
Fiona. I've never been better.

Fiona smiled warmly, and the parents then heard their kids playfully roaring.

Fergus:
Roar!

All triplets began roaring and giggling. Shrek was even happy to see his
kids existing as he went to them.

Shrek:
(rubs Farkle's head) Happy Birthday, Farkle. Fergus, my little man! And Felicia,
sweetheart.

His baby daughter looked at him with big, happy, blue eyes. He
then reached his pocket and handed her the squeaky ogre plush toy
he magically came back into this world with.

Shrek:
I believe this is yours.

She hugged the toy tightly.

Felicia:
Thank you, Daddy.

Shrek:
(picking up his kids and holding them) Awww.

Donkey:
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about giving my babies an encore!

Puss:
Please, senior, let us have it!
The others insisted eagerly. However, instead of a roar, Shrek held his nose and blew
a toot threw his ears. Then, all three of his babies held their noses and
blew smaller toots through their ears. As their friends applauded and
Puss waved a little yellow flag, Fiona was astounded.

Fiona:
(holds Fergus) I didn't know we could do that.

Donkey:
That's my best friend!

Shrek then looked towards Fiona.

Shrek:
You know, I always thought that I rescued you from the Dragon's Keep.

Fiona:
You did.

Shrek:
No. It was you that rescued me.

The
two smiled warmly before kissing with their babies hugging them, while everyone che
ered. Then, the scene changed to a picture of the still scene in the final page of a
book Shrek had out.

                                      THE END
