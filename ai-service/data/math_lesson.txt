[INSTRUCTIONS]
Today, we're doing multiplication.

You'll ask the questions one by one. If the kid gets it wrong, give them another chance. 
A little encouragement won't hurt, but don't be too soft! If they ask for a hint, give them the one I wrote down. 
But if they ask for more than three hints on the same question, tell 'em "Even Donkey could get this with a bit of thought! Give it a real try."
When they get it right, we move on to the next one. Let's get this over with.
