                      SCENE 1
         Shrek’s House (Morning)


Shrek: It's so good to be home! Donkey?


Donkey: Shrek! Fiona!


Shrek: Donkey, what are you doing here?


Donkey: Taking care of your love nest for you.


Shrek: Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail
and watering the plants?


Donkey: Yeah, and feeding the fish!


Shrek: I don't have any fish.


Donkey: You do now.


Shrek: Oh! Look at the time. I guess you'd
better be going.


Donkey: Don't you want to tell me about your
trip?


                         1
Shrek: Erghh!


Fiona: Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?


Donkey: Oh, yeah, that. I don't know. She's
been all moody and stuff lately. I thought I'd
move in with you guys.


Fiona: You know we're always happy to see you,
Donkey.


Shrek: But Fiona and I are married now. We need
a little time, you know, to be together.


Donkey: ...


Shrek: Just with each other.


Donkey: ...


Shrek: Alone.


Donkey: Say no more. You don't have to worry
about a thing. I will always be here to make
sure nobody bothers you.

                       2
Shrek: Donkey!


Donkey: Yes, roomie?


Shrek: You're bothering me.


Donkey: Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess... Me
and Pinocchio was going to catch a tournament,
anyway, so... Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday for a
barbecue or something.


Shrek: He'll be fine. Now, where were we?


Fiona: I think I remember.


Shrek: Donkey!


Donkey: I know, I know! Alone! I'm going! I'm
going. But what do you want me to tell these
other guys?


    "Dearest Princess Fiona. You are hereby
summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away for a
royal ball in celebration of your marriage "at
   which time the King will bestow his royal
 blessing... upon you and your... uh...Prince


                       3
Charming. "Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far
            Away. aka Mom and Dad."
Fiona: Mom and Dad?


Shrek: Prince Charming?


Donkey: Royal ball? Can I come?


Shrek: We're not going.


Fiona & Donkey: What?!


Shrek: I mean, don't you think they might be a
bit... shocked to see you like this? Well, they
might be a bit surprised.


Fiona: But they're my parents, Shrek. They love
me. And don't worry. They'll love you, too.


Shrek: Yaa right, Somehow I don't think I'll be
welcome at the country club.


Fiona: Stop it. They're not like that.


Shrek: How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and
the Fancy Pants Club Band?


                          4
Fiona: Oh, come on! You could at least give
them a chance.
Shrek: To do what? Sharpen their pitchforks?


Fiona: No! They just want to give you their
blessing.


Shrek: Oh, great. Now I need their blessing?


Fiona: If you want to be a part of this family,
yes!


Shrek: Who says I want to be part of this
family?


Fiona: You did! When you married me!


Shrek: Well, there's some fine print for you!


Fiona: [exasperated sigh] So that's it. You
won't come?


Shrek: Trust me. It's a bad idea. We are not
going! And that's final!


Donkey: Come on, Shrek! We don't want to hit
traffic!

That's where we're going. Far, far... [softly]
away...



                        8
Donkey: All right, all right, I get it. I'm
just so darn bored.
Shrek: Well, find a way to entertain yourself.


Donkey: Umm...


Donkey: [clicks tongue] 2X


Shrek: For five minutes... Could you not be
yourself... [shouts]... for five minutes!


Donkey: [clicks tongue]


Shrek: Erghh! Are we there yet?!

    Shrek, Princess Fiona & Donkey
  arrived at the Kingdom of Far Far
                 Away.
                    (Evening)


      Announcing the long-awaited return
        of the beautiful Princess Fiona
              and her new husband.


Fiona: Well, this is it.

King: This is it.

Donkey: This is it.

                      [Fanfare]

           [Fanfare & cheering stop]

                    [Baby wails]

Donkey: Uh... why don't you guys go ahead? I'll
park the car.

Shrek: [Chuckles] So... you still think this
was a good idea?

Fiona: Of course! Look. Mom and Dad look happy
to see us.


                         11
King: [softly] Who on earth are they?

Queen: [softly] I think that's our little girl.


King: That's not little! That's a really big
problem. Wasn't she supposed to kiss Prince
Charming and break the spell?

Queen: Well, he's no Prince Charming, but they
do look...

Shrek: [softly] Happy now? We came. We saw
them. Now let's go before they light the
torches.

Fiona: They're my parents.

Shrek: Hello? They locked you in a tower.

Fiona: Heyy! That was for my own...

King: Good! Here's our chance. Let's go back
inside and pretend we're not home.

Queen: Harold, we have to be...

Shrek: Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

Fiona: Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna be...

King: A disaster! There is no way...

Fiona: You can do this.

Shrek: I really...


                      12
King: Really...

Queen: Don’t..

Fiona: To...
Queen: Be...

Fiona: Mom... Dad... I'd like you to meet my
husband... Shrek.

Shrek: [Awkward smile]
Well, umm ...

Queen & King : ????

Shrek: It's easy to see where Fiona gets her
good looks from.
[chuckles nervously] [gulp]

                      SCENE 4

            An awkward dinner.
                  (Night)

Fiona: Burrp... Excuse me hehe...

Shrek: Hehehe... Better out than in,I always
say, eh, Fiona?

[both giggle]

Shrek: That’s good hehehe...

Fiona: Errr...

Shrek: I guess not.

Donkey: What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am. What's
happening, everybody? Thanks for waiting. I had
the hardest time finding this place.

King: No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

Fiona: No, Dad! It's all right. It's all right.
He's with us. He helped rescue me from the
dragon.

Donkey: That's me: the noble steed. Hey Waiter!
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?

Shrek: Oh boy... [Slurps]

Fiona: Um, Shrek?



                         14
Shrek: Yeah? Oh, sorry. Great soup, Mrs Q.
Mmm...

Fiona: No, no. Darling.

Shrek: Oh! hehe [chuckles nervously]

Queen: So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.

Fiona: Well... Shrek owns his own land. Don't
you, honey?

Shrek: Oh yes! It's in an enchanted forest
abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies
and...

Donkey: What?! I know you ain't talking about
the swamp.

King: An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original.

Queen: Well... I suppose that would be a fine
place to raise the children.

[splutters]
[chokes]

Shrek: It's a bit early to be thinking about
that, isn't it?

King: Indeed. I just started eating.

Queen: Harold!

Shrek: What's that supposed to mean?

Fiona: Dad. It's great, OK?


                      15
King: Yaa... For his type, yes.

Shrek: My type?!

Donkey: I got to go to the bathroom.

               Dinner is served!

Donkey: Never mind. I can hold it.

                   Bon appetit!

Donkey: Oh, Mexican food! My favorite!

Queen: Well... Let's not sit here with our
tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in.

Donkey: Don't mind if I do, Lillian.

King: I suppose any grandchildren I could
expect from you would be...

Shrek: Ogres, yes!

Queen: Not that there's anything wrong with
that. Right, Harold?

King: That is, assuming you don't eat your own
young!

Fiona: Dad!

Shrek: No, we usually prefer the ones who've
been locked away in a tower!

Fiona: Shrek, Please!

King: I only did that because I love her.

                        16
Shrek:   Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle.

King: You wouldn't understand. You're not her
father!

Fiona: Haihh

Queen: It's so nice to have the family together
for dinner.

Queen: Harold!

Fiona: Shrek!

Shrek: Fiona!

Fiona: Mom...

Queen: Harold...

Donkey: Donkey!

            King Authur’s Room

                   (Night)

King: I knew this would happen.

Queen: You should. You started it.

King: I can hardly believe that, Lillian. He's
the ogre. Not me.

Queen: I think, Harold, you're taking this a
little too personally. This is Fiona's choice.


King: But she was supposed to choose the prince
we picked for her. I mean, you expect me to
give my blessings to this... thing?


Queen: Fiona does. And she'll never forgive you
if you don't. I don't want to lose our daughter
again, Harold. Don't you remember when we were
young? We used to walk down by the lily pond
and... they were in bloom...


King: Our first kiss... It's not the same! I
don't think you realize that our daughter has
married a monster!


Queen: Oh, stop being such a drama king.

                      18
King: Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong! La,
di, da, di, da! Isn't it all wonderful! I'd
like to know how it could get any worse!

     Outside Princess Fiona’s Room
                   (Night)
King: [knock on door] Sorry. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.


Shrek: No, no. I was just reading a, uh... a
scary book.


King: I was hoping you'd let me apologize for
my despicable behaviour earlier.


Shrek: Okay...


King: I don't know what came over me. Do you
suppose we could pretend it never happened and
start over...


Shrek: Look, Your Majesty, I just...


King: Please. Call me Dad.


Shrek: Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe we
just need some time to get to know each other.


King: Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you
might join me for a morning hunt. A little
                      20
father-son time? I know it would mean the world
to Fiona.
Shrek: [sighs]
King: Shall we say, by the old oak?
Shrek: Okay...


                   THE END
